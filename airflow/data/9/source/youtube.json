"published": "8 months ago", "transcript": " today our sort of topic is this idea of a Bionic supply chain yes and certainly sounds very futuristic why would you say historically it's been so difficult for humans to kind of interact with these machines the executives I talked to they don't see yet that the full value out of the supply chain has come huh and for my insight is it's because the humans were quite busy in trying to understand how can I collaborate with a machine it's much more demanding to do it with algorithms and to do it with Excel for example I think what has lost focus is a little bit that enter and supply chain management is about enter enter surprisingly it's not about focusing on a sub function it's about aligning and synchronizing the end-to-end supply chain and that in my eyes has lost a little bit of focus so now we have to enter into the Bionic type of thing too we emphasize that humans need to collaborate obviously with the help of machines and that is I think what has not happened yet and that is why some executives are frustrated because the investments haven't paid off therefore we are saying it needs a bionic operating model which is essentially for four elements it's first of all the guidance in the supply chain so the good old K P is what do we want to achieve with our supply chain secondly skills of course I mean totally different set of people who are capable of designing the end-to-end supply chain then the operating model which is in our belief a very much platform driven operating model to put the people who are synchronizing the supply chain together even physically together sometimes and then technological platform but maybe not at the the first one but as the the foundation of of course we need it and that in very few companies has been established so far and therefore I think historically that is a bit of a disappointed disappointment about the cheetah project this concept of a digital twin how does that kind of fit in with an idea of Bionic supply chain the idea to have a representation of the enter and supply chain and I fully agree with you it will never be a 100% accurate representation but at the moment we have a 10 percent accurate end-to-end representation so if there is something like a 80 percent good representation of the end-to-end supply chain and we start learning how the system dynamics in in the end-to-end supply chain is and if if I have a spike in demand forecast here what does it mean on my target inventory what does it mean how can I play around with my production sequence what does it mean on my supply side what are the scenarios the end-to-end scenarios that I can play through if we start thinking in this way then a digital twin in the best sense can be the vehicle to enable the people who are running the end-to-end supply chain to play around with scenarios and take smart decisions what would a successful supply chain initiative Bionic supply chain initiative look like the truth is there will I think there will always be human interaction needed so what we need to design for a successful supply chain is a human centric still operating model which will run the supply chain of the future and that is the operating model elements that I have described earlier"}, {"id": "8IcBHjYFwZ8", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcBHjYFwZ8",

another edition of a firmsconsulting case video today we're going to look at operations cases and I must say that invariably I find most candidates struggle with operations cases it seems that everyone wants to be a strategy consultant everyone spends their time looking at strategy cases such as how do you enter a market what do you do if a product line is failing how do you deal with the deregulation of the market and while those are exciting cases and to be fair I used to be a corporate strategy consultant so you know I do find them interesting the reality is that operations cases are an essential part of case interviewing and you have to understand them and to be honest operations cases are more difficult than strategy cases because in strategy cases most people can figure their way through them but in operations cases unless you really understand the language and you have some context you are going to fail so what we're going to do is we're going to present an Operations case here that tests whether you understand the basics or the first principles of operations if you don't understand the first principles of operations you would not be able to solve this case and invariably you would not be able to solve the even more complex operations cases and as I mentioned many times and as this case is going to show operations cases are numerically challenging because you tend to be dealing with unit allocations and little tiny numbers that you need to add up across now the thing about operations cases if you do want to learn about operations cases you can go read several books a book that we recommend is the book goal by I think it's dr. Eli Goldratt you don't need to read the whole book I think it's about 300 pages you could get a summary and there are many summaries available at that book in fact the two to three page summary just explain the core concepts would be more than enough for you but that is for a different day today we'll assume that you have an understanding of operations so you can maybe go ahead and pause this case and if you don't have an understanding we'll teach you the basics of operations the case we're going to do is a McKinsey case it's rated at the difficult level and it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to solve this case the math should come quick because it's basic math but the logic of how you're going to do these things should take a little bit longer the case is Pepsi has one major Balkan plot in Los Angeles in last three month months inventory as more than doubled while customer complaints that's the people that Pepsi Bottling Company is delivering the cans of Cola to or the bottles of Cola are complaining because basically we don't know why but their complaints have gone up fivefold so what so the question is what would you do well in a real case the first thing you got to do is understand all of the information you've been presented with so for me personally the thing that stands out there that I'm not very clear about is when they talk about customer complaints they haven't explained why there are customer complaints right and as you know as we teach our candice if you experience or you've given a lot of data the odds are pretty good that they're expecting a framework before any clarifying questions right that's - pretty much my McKinsey and Baines handle cases and while this is the McKinsey case I've kind of presented it like a BCG model with very little data the conceptual issues are hidden and you've got to dig it out in a McKinsey case they tell you really really clearly this is the only problem there are no curveballs move ahead with the case right so let's now explore this case given the fact that so little information has been presented to us I think it's fair to say that we can ask additional questions but even so just to be fair I would always check with the interviewer whether he wants my clarifying questions or where they wants to see my approach first let's assume this is a friendly guy he had breakfast this morning and he's really happy to have a good chat with you so what are the questions I would ask him well firstly inventory could mean many things is it finished inventory that's sitting in a warehouse or is it inventory in progress that's an inventory that's arriving from suppliers very important point because depending on the inventory you have it's either a delivery problem or it's a production problem because inventory in progress is coming into the manufacturing process finished goods inventory as left the manufacturing process or says why am i wire customers complaining that's an obvious one I think many of us would have picked that up if we were doing this case I'd like to know about how much we want to reduce inventory and customer delivery times I think that gives us a target we're trying to chase and as you know most candidates do struggle with cases because while they do the case as well they don't know where the deadline is if you know about how much the interviewer wants you to reduce inventory and customer delivery times you know when to stop the case when you reach that target then obviously I'd like to know are there any other objectives noise profitability return on investment return on invested capital are there any other targets we need to worry about and of course if there's more targets than just inventory in customer complaints the case becomes much more difficult because the more targets you are trying to chase the more things you have to keep in the back of your head so let's assume that we're told that all of the inventory some supplies that's coming in before the manufacturing process customers are complaining because they're you know delivery times have gone up dramatically triple to gone up to about five times inventory reduction and customer delivery time reductions as much as possible and there are no other objectives what do we do now well the next step should be quite obvious now that we've been given all this information I would take a few seconds I tell the interviewer I take a few seconds to gather my thoughts and I would present my key question how can we reduce inventory costs and customer delivery times at the LA bottling plant now the kind of framework we give you here is a framework that if you presented it to an interviewer he would be unhappy so listen very carefully what I'm going to tell you next he would be unhappy so that you need to handle this in a certain way so let's present the framework and show you how you handle it first you need to look at inbound logistics that is stuff that is coming into the manufacturing process we know there's a problem with supplies but we don't know if it's a problem with suppliers right there could be a parameter supplies on our side in the way we order or they could be a problem with supplies on the way they fulfill our orders manufacturing we've been given no indication that manufacturing is a problem right so for now we just assume there's no problem there and we know the in terms of outbound logistics we have some information saying that deliveries our problem for those of you are not familiar with this this entire three-step process is known as the supply chain if you go into an interview and tell an interview I'm going to analyze the entire supply chain that's my framework they will laugh at you or they'll throw something at you hopefully something that heavy so what you've got to tell an interviewer that preempt them say look I understand this is the entire supply chain by no means intend to say that this is my entire framework this is just some considerations that what I'm going to do now is identify which part I'm going to analyze and why that way we can narrow down our framework to just one point that we want to analyze and focus our case make sense let's continue the step from here is obviously asking a few questions to determine whether the problem lies in the inbound side on the manufacturing side or the outbound side and you've got to be efficient you can't ask a lot of questions you've got to ask one or two questions that eloquently and efficiently show you understand the problem so what would those questions be well firstly I would like to know why we are buying more materials well clearly there's some hold up there so why are we buying more materials has anything changed in the manufacturing process you'd be shocked how many people forget to answer ask this really basic question it just baffles me you know we've been doing this can't your cases with some Korean students recently and one of the things you've got to understand about the Korean education system is it's quite advanced but operations cases don't seem to be on the table on the menu for South Korean students they really good at strategy cases but they really mess up operations cases and I just did a session with about maybe five Korean students and all of them fail to get this issue now it's not just Korea that struggles yet because obviously an outstanding education system but we find invariably Candice from across the world struggle because no one is primed to think in operations terms outbound logistics I would like to know why customer orders are delivered late so look at the sequence here right we were told they are complaining then we found out why they're complaining because they are delivered late and now we want to know why they're delivered late so let's see what the interviewer tells us well he's going to tell me demand has gone up from six thousand bottles a day to ten thousand bottles a day since it is now summer that makes sense you know as demand goes up you'll buy more raw materials more inventory to fulfill demand they've changed nothing in the manufacturing so there's interesting because the manufacturing process for six thousand bottles is the same as the manufacturing process for ten thousand bottles not necessarily a good thing but a clue as well and customer orders are late because the factory is not producing sufficient Cola to meet demand and we have forced a can for shipment right that years some interesting clues for you that you can take and work with right and very basic stuff here basically due to demand an increase in demand more supplies are being bought but due to something in manufacturing those supplies are not being converted to finished products which is why there's a delayed customer so clearly there's a manufacturing problem we've got enough inbound supplies coming in but they're not being converted in the manufacturing process and obviously the outbound process is failing because there's nothing to take from manufacturing to customers so let's explain this with some numbers right let's look at the former state before demand went up demand was six thousand bottles a day right so my hypothesis is that due to a bottleneck or other manufacturing problem this is causing an inventory buildup and manufacturing shortfall which is leading to customer delays and notice the fact that I've got three parts to my hypothesis and I pollicis can never be that there's a manufacturing problem that is an hypothesis that belongs in a non accredited college if you go to an accredited college you should understand lipolysis must have three parts you must have the observable phenomenon the cause and the effect if you gave me an iPod thesis with just two of the three parts I'm okay with it but if you give me a hypothesis that cannot be tested if you just tell me something like there's a manufacturing problem and you cannot test it that's never going to fly so let's look at this in a graphical layout so let's lay out the manufacturing process let's assume there's just three parts to the manufacturing process right the first part is where you get the bottles and you sterilize it and let's assume the capacity of that plant for a day of that part of the plant per day is 10,000 bottles a day filling of the bottles with Cola the capacity is 9000 bottles a day and the bottling when I mean bottling I mean putting a cap on those bottles is 8,000 bottles a day right so let's look what happens on a typical week you've got six thousand bottles six thousand bottles bought because that's the demand per day the product deficit that means that the product the demand that is not met is zero because all six thousand can go through the production process because the bottleneck is above six thousand and that happens for the whole week from day 1 to day 2 to day 3 today for today 5 so everyone's happy all the customers are happy right but what happens in demand close to 10,000 bottles a day well the bottling side where you're putting a cap becomes a bottleneck because we've demand exceeds supply you have a bottleneck and if you have a bottleneck it's automatically a production problem so now we know we have a bottleneck and what does that mean in terms of happy or happy customers well lets them erase this and see what that means so we now have 10,000 bottles of inventory being bought right that's logical right what is the product deficit well in the first day you can have 10,000 bottles going into the manufacturing process and being queued up only 8,000 bottles are going to come up so in terms of the product deficit demand not being met we have 2,000 bottles not being met right make sense let's go to day two right in day two what's going to happen well in date two what you have is that from day one you've got 2,000 bottles that have queued up I was in excess inventory so waiting to come in and then in day - you've got the $2,000 bottle deficit from day one plus the two thousand two thousand bottle deficit from day two giving you four thousand bottles of demand that are not being met day three same thing right in day two you now have four thousand bottles queuing up plus the two thousand that are going to come in from day three you've got a six thousand bottle deficit and you can simply repeat the process now what happens when you repeat the process is you find out that this very innocuous bottleneck problem is causing a dramatic queue whereby by the end of the first week you're going to have 10,000 bottles queuing up and if 10,000 bottles are queuing up for manufacturing that means 10,000 bottles that need to go through manufacturing and not going through manufacturing and you've got a product deficit of 10,000 now that we've outlined this problem hopefully a little bit eloquently what do we do with this well if you've identified the problem the next step is obviously to generate options to fix said problem you have two options here the first option is you can fix the bottleneck so that all the supplies are used and there is no product deficit and/or inventory buildup now McKinsey particularly and I would say all firms want to see creativity I get really bored of the case when someone is just throwing out the most basic stuff right so let's look for a really creative answer yeah we know this is a seasonal problem because during summer the problem occurs so another more creative solution is that we shift production to a neighboring water like maybe I don't know in the VAD I think it's close to California and we import the product deficit into Los Angeles we clay could even shift production to maybe a neighboring bottle maybe in San Diego San Francisco somewhere within California but the point is you don't have to necessarily do any changes to the LA plant now obviously here you gotta prioritize which option do you analyze first right once you've presented your options you've got to analyze them you've got to analyze them on certain criteria and decide which option you want to pursue dealing with your own plant is probably the best thing to do because potentially there are ways to fix your bottleneck without incurring significant cost you want to look at that first and only if that's not a solution then you look at making massive capital changes or shifting production so let's explore that let's take this even further right so fixing if you want to fix the bottleneck we have three options we can move quality lashawn's before the bottleneck I can show you right now when I tell people this is a potential solution they look at me with a blank face or they look at they look at me like I just told them the earth is actually flat and it's not round expanding the bottleneck is an obvious solution that's what most people say and sharing the bottleneck work with another part of the plant they may be another part of the plant who could do the same work as the bottleneck with a few changes so this is creative and it's usually possible because what happens is plants do have spare equipment or they do have other equipment that can do the work of the bottleneck so now let's look at the one about moving QA before the bottle like I'm going to explore this in more detail because it's the one most people to understand the least but of course all of them you have to explore right you have to look at the criterion what is the cost-benefit analysis of doing each to come up with a recommendation but we just going to look at the Q&A one because I think it makes the most sense here so let's look at moving Q&A before the bottleneck now what does this mean right let's go back to our plant we've got three steps in the plant sterilizing the bottles filling them up with Cola and I'm putting a little cap on them on the day one we've got 10,000 bottles if the bottleneck is 8,000 we assume 8,000 bottles will come out but it's not true the apparent capacity of the plant is only a hundred percent that is to the apparent capacity is 100 percent in reality you are going to have some defects occurring let's assume the defects are 5 percent right which is 400 bottles the real capacity of the plant is 95% and if you spread this across you know you're losing $400 a day for the plant right so 5 percent of products going through the bottleneck will be rejected meaning the bottleneck is not working on hundred percent capacity but rather just 95 percent capacity so what you can do is you can see here that if you look at the losses they're quite significant they keep on adding up every single day right it's four hundred a day if you can move the queue a step before the bottleneck right you would remove these products before they entered the bottleneck so rather than sending only seven thousand five seven thousand six hundred good products to the bottleneck you would send eight thousand products to the bottleneck because the products that we're going to be kicked out after the bottleneck would be kicked out before the bottleneck thereby only sending good products to the bottleneck what this means is that if you move the QA or part of the QA before the bottleneck you ensure maximum product is produced but now the case you have to ask yourself is well you can fix this and it's quite easy to fix should you make capital expansions to address the 1600 bottles that you still need to find remember demand is ten thousand if you've found another four hundred you've got eight thousand four hundred moving through which means you've got one thousand six hundred bottles that are not moving through now since this is seasonal importing seems to make more sense to me I would actually say why go through all these capital changes when just for four or five months of the year we can get another plant to work it may be slightly high capacity without any chain just to their production right so let's just recap where we've come with this case well you've got to tie up the case right and that's what you and I mean what's what I mean when I say recap this is what I'll do I'll tell them interview that in this case the inventory build-up and delays and customer deliveries are driven by the same problem right it's basically a bottleneck in the bottling step of the bottling plant and they fix the problem we can do many things but the simplest thing we can do immediately would least amount of effort is move QA before the bottleneck we can improve throughput capacity by five percent and we assume it'll cost us nothing right this means that we still need to find another one thousand six hundred bottles per day right and there are two ways we can address this we can introduce capital expansion into the plant or we can shift capacity to another plant that may have idle capacity right and of course comparing the capital side of things capital changes and conveying the option the broad option of shifting capacity to another plant will have to do a cost-benefit analysis but all other things being equal shifting it because it's seasonal and it's going to come back to normal shifting it another plant would tend to make the most amount of sense to me so now that we've covered this case let's sort of recap some of the key things you need to know the observations here is that in the supply chain everything needs to be broken down into three convenient steps but you've got to understand that this is a very broad process and if you just tell the interviewer you're going to go with the entire supply chain they're not going to be happy so you have to quickly follow that by saying that I'm going to use a few sets of clarifying questions to pinpoint where I think the problem is and develop a hypothesis and that is where we will focus the analysis when you think of a supply chain you should think of a set of dominoes you move one part of the Domino there's a ripple effect across the supply chain your job is to find the relationship between these seemingly unrelated problems because here we saw that infantry was a problem and customers at no time did we think that manufacturing could be a problem until we understood the relationship of the different parts of production in a supply chain I'll tell you again operations cases of a numerical require lots of calculations and I love doing them with candidates in the final stages of the training one of the most famous cases we do is a Russian mobile telecommunications case looking at how dropped calls increases during the Russian which in Moscow peak rush hour between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock failure rate on that case sets are closed about a hundred percent and I always find that candidates make mistakes there because of unit conversions you're dealing with bottles per day bottles per cycle set up a time number of people per hour labor cost per a unit of product you don't use units you are going to die for those of you who are in our training and have gone through our estimation cases you know how important unit conversions are in operations cases I think of a very big estimation case with a lot of different equations equations without units is language without structure no structure no understanding everything fails operations cases can always be broken down to three steps if you don't understand bottlenecks and operations cases you are dead understand that process the principles of solving operations cases for those of us with those if you've been through the training you know we we take this directly into estimation case when you look at supply and demand we're taking the telecoms cases we take it heavily into IT cases the point is knowing operations cases is not just important for operations cases it's important for all kinds of cases now if you really want to improve your knowledge you should understand marginal cost analysis because I find that when we start when we when we give you a case with an Operations concept and marginal costing I would say most candidates fail them most candidates really struggle to understand this concept and you should look it up because in future cases that you do with us we are going to throw this concept at you these cases tend to be very long there's no way you're going to be able to go through inbound logistics manufacturing outbound logistics on top to bottom you'd be there forever your job is to quickly pinpoint the problem let the interviewer know that you know the framework is too big and that you understand you have to pinpoint the problem right so let's just look at how candidates have done generally in this case so what we've done here is we've taken a case summary looking at how candidates have done across the last two years with us on this kinds of cases in terms of case skill requirement you have to be very good at case structuring and very good at communication to solve operations case it's very good a case structuring because if you have the wrong structure you are basically going around in a maze or you're gonna have to if you use the wrong structure the structure may tend out to be so cumbersome to use you are never ever going to develop it right you're never going to solve the problem the second thing is because you're dealing with so many units of calculations and bottles per day cost per hour units per second unless you are really communicating what you want to do why you want to do it how you want to do it there's a great chance of miscommunication I know many candidates will resonate with the point I'm going to make if you ask me the wrong question and I answer the question correctly you are screwed and I do find that with many candidates what they want to ask me and what they ask me is the interviewer is very different from what they intend to ask and if you ask the wrong question I give you the right information for the wrong question you're going to end up being totally lost in a case especially when you're dealing with these very nuanced units of conversion but how do candidates do well I would say that the reason this case is so challenging is because it expects you to understand operations cases at its core the case is not challenging but the principles it applies means you must understand operations and if you don't well you know what you did how do candidates do I find MBA candidates do okay in this case they tend to do well on business judgment they tend to be do well in case structuring because most MBA schools have taught in operations costs and a lot of candidates can bring that to the table but I can tell you right now all MBA students struggle and I don't think anyone's ever finished this case so while their business judgment may be strong they're not able to parlay that into communicating with me effectively to extract good insights from me as the interviewer but also from extracting guidance from me and case structuring our find to be quite a weak for MBA candidates what I do find is that undergraduates tend to be a weak on communication and weaken business judgment and they weaken business judgment here because I do find that undergraduate programs in business and generally history art scientists don't teach operations so operations is something you've got to read and the only reason I post sorry undergraduate students do badly it's because they don't have this operations background but I do still feel that our undergraduate candidates do better on the arithmetic and calculations in our MBA candidates and this is looking across the last year and sort of averaging out performance for all the candidates who have been through the program why will you fail this case you have week operations knowledge you need to get the summary of operations from any MBA textbook and you'll be fine as always I'll be happy to respond to any questions and I do hope that you found this case to be very useful to your preparation and training thank you"}, {"id": "WoxrIyVGSq8", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxrIyVGSq8", "title": "BCG's Amit Ganeriwalla on Supply

access goods and services that requires whether your strategic objectives of the company are aligned to what you want to do in the supply chain we found that supply chains are I'm going to go through a big shift over the next few years there is a reshoring that's happening you know in several markets closer to demand but be it United states-mexico some parts of Western Europe and as these manufacturing setups or the networks get a redesign that will have a big impact on how supply chains player role going forward with emerging technologies and digital supply chain as we call it will have two broad impacts one new business models will emerge existing business models will get will get destroyed or will get absolute and the second will be efficiencies in systems and processes now the pace at which this is moving as a company we see if you're not going to take action on either of these or if you're not going to build capabilities in technology and digital let me have a longer-term adverse impact in the business all of these in according to us is not going to be possible as an overlay on your existing supply chain of business you actually have to bake the technology in digital aspect into your business model into your organization into your processes and not as an afterthought of overlaying it you need to redesign you know how a performance measures work you need to make sure collaboration with the supply chain partners is enhanced and and those are built into you the way you collaborate and work with them and similarly you need to build capability in the front end in terms of how you deliver these products and services digital supply chain is clearly something that many clients are asking for at this point in time they want to build capability with assisting several of them from you know from one level of saying how do you use gigabytes of data that exist within your organization and how do you use and process that to be able to drive inside and

4068, "published": "6 years ago", "transcript": " major trends today are linked to the fact that companies are more and more global they're global in their sourcing so they're they're sourcing from all over the world and their global and their customer because temir bases as well what this means is they're facing more and more disruptive events more and more different forms and new forms of competition and as a result supply chains are becoming more complex and harder to manage a misalignment between strategy and supply chain will lead to a deterioration in performance so deterioration in the bottom line and the balance sheet so noticeably you have higher costs more inventory required lost sales but you also have indirect effects so the poor supply chain will lead to plants being underutilized sales being missed so there are quite a few impacts on on the bottom line too often I I work with clients where I will hear service levels of 99 percent and we're extremely happy with the service we deliver but when you ask clients how they see it it's a whole different picture and so understanding where the performance truly is starting from is a key point once you've done that there are a number of things you can do that around the strategy itself for the network so is the supply chain designed properly our processes lean enough and respected or are we using the right tools and what I find is that is also quite important to look at capabilities so talent and behaviors as well so are the right incentives in place it's extremely important that supply chain know what the true measures are not just optimizing the metrics but also ensuring that the business outcomes are there so when I say ninety-nine percent service level I should have extremely satisfied customers if I have 99 percent availability in a store as a shopper I should be able to find just about everything I'm looking for and too often there's a big discrepancy between what we think supply chain is delivering and what the reality is on the field we always ground that try to ground the effort with looping back to strategy so how is the supply chain supporting the strategy well and where is the supply chain not supporting the strategy and we do that using the combination of analysis internal/external we try to benchmark with competition we try to meet the management if if appropriate we'll talk to suppliers and we'll talk to some of the company's clients to get a realistic view you know what is the starting point where are the opportunities where are the issues based on that then we'll tend to focus on a portfolio of initiatives trying to balance the I suppose the medium-term design of the right supply chain but also focusing on short-term performance improvement to realize value quickly and in doing that it will it will encompass interventions on the strategy the network processes tools capabilities incentives everything that needs to be that needs to be managed for supply chain to work properly"}, {"id": "rlrv2VsD4Qg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlrv2VsD4Qg", "title": "Digital Evolution of Global Supply Chains", "channel": "Boston Consulting Group",

versatile and also a lot more resilient I think that as supply chains have evolved they've tapped into a number of interesting technologies digital technologies that allow them to get much more granular information real time information and that allows managers to make better decisions that makes them more flexible more versatile I think another important element that's going to come into play here has to do with global trade companies now are facing the harsh reality that you know changes in the global trade landscape are affecting them directly and for the first time in decades they're having to look for alternative suppliers in regions that they don't even operate in that's that's a big change and so I think that companies you know going forward will perhaps need to get used to being a little bit more flexible but that's going to take quite a bit of work"}, {"id": "2gIi2Ad-V60", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gIi2Ad-V60", "title": "Supply Chain Management: BCG's Pierre Mercier on effective supply chain management", "channel": "Boston Consulting Group", "duration": "2:20", "views": 927, "published": "9 years ago", "transcript": " the biggest challenge companies face today when it comes to supply chain is understanding how supply chain can drive competitive advantage that's difficult for multiple reasons the first one is that our supply chain requirements will vary by product segment by Channel and geography and companies that need to recognize that in setup supply chains accordingly the second difficulty is the fact that these requirements evolve over time and as these requirements change supply chains need to adapt and so companies need to constantly be on the lookout to make sure their supply chain fits their requirements at all times a typical mistake that companies make when it comes to supply chain is a one-size-fits-all approach across all channels products and geographies most companies still operate in silos and therefore supply chain opportunities or requirements are neither well perceived nor understood it's key to think holistically about all functions involved in supply chain from sales and distribution back into manufacturing back into sourcing or even product design and actually supply chains need to be integrated upstream with suppliers and also downstream with customers and that is what a true intense supply chain needs to look like supply chain implementation requires a truly cross-functional effort while it can't be easy to define this connect the conceptual solutions it's extremely difficult to implement so supply chain directors or operations directors are usually leading this effort but the most successful companies I have seen are those companies were the CEO or the commercial director get involved and understand the supply chain challenges and trade-offs one key trend and supply chain over the last years has been to support faster and faster innovation with collapsing time to market cycles another evolution has been to juggle with more and more complexity as companies grow their product portfolios diversify their earlier channels and their geographies there's still a long way to go in general supply chain as a function is less embedded than sales or marketing manufacturing or product design I think it will be another five or ten years before companies fully leverage the power and the benefits of an effective supply chain when you look at it it great great big opportunity"}, {"id": "5S6ChvU1K8Y", "link":

months ago", "transcript": " [Music] so we've been talking about the bionic company now let's talk about data and ai this is about making better business decisions by leveraging the combined strengths of humans and algorithms it's about companies creating new data muscle which includes data strategy and sourcing new skills and ways of working around data and ai technology and governance across industries data and ai are rapidly changing the competitive landscape from supporting more efficient operations such as predictive maintenance and staffing optimizations to dynamically personalizing interactions with customers we also see a broad range of new business models based on platforms and proprietary data bionic companies have an incredible focus on where and how they can create value from data as companies move from a system in which decisions are made by humans to one where decisions are made jointly by humans and ai they build up an ability to collect manage and use data from many different sources uber the well-known taxi sharing platform uses massive amounts of real-time data to efficiently match drivers with customers our research shows that companies who invest in data and ai are twice as likely to succeed in their digital transformations they are also more likely to generate superior returns in comparison to their competitors they have a very different data muscle the first is strategy bionic companies target large value pools such as pricing and personalization in commercial functions they create a path to proprietary data about their customers and their operations often this is a combination of existing data and new data for example real-time supply chain tracking or measuring marketing campaigns to optimize across multiple channels the second part of a data muscle is creating new ways of working with data and ai algorithms in our experience the algorithms are only 10 percent of the challenge the technology is 20 and the rest 70 is really about changing ways of working it's about having the skills and talent as well as the methods needed to drive real impact and for sure new skills will be required in data science and in technology such as data engineering these skills will be required throughout the organization but importantly managers will also need to be much more fluent with data and advanced analytic techniques people need to learn new ways of working and importantly to trust the way algorithms are working before there's real impact it's the process of using algorithms to augment what people do that needs to be the focus this will require building new cross-functional ways of working and building ongoing learning and innovation into machine and ai operations the third part of our data muscle is really around creating the foundational technology and data governance which liberates data from core systems and ensures appropriate use data needs to be liberated from core technology applications and functional silos this enables the exchange of data seamlessly across traditional application areas and across traditional organizational boundaries data governance needs to be developed to ensure appropriate use of data and ai algorithms for example take profiling and facial recognition it's critical to ensure that the biases present in the data sets of today are not perpetuated in the algorithms of tomorrow the very blood of bionic companies is data it brings machines and ai to life so we encourage you to think about data and ai and its role in the bionic company in the future"}, {"id": "vp474EpYxus",

"views": 534, "published": "5 months ago", "transcript": " [Music] welcome back to leading in the new reality live I'm here with my great colleagues Carol and Sharon and today we will be discussing the future of supply chains in the light of the pandemic and the general development that supply chains are going through taking a step back looking at the global trade flows then global trade Reid reached a record-high level last year 2019 18 trillion US dollars unfortunately this year 2020 our projected predictions in BCG is that global trade is likely to drop between minus 10 and minus 30 percent compared to last year's level now of course this is due to the fact that consumers have cut back on their spending as we as we've been hit by the pandemic across the world the big question is when will global trade flows come back at the 2008 19 level and how will this happen our predictions right now it's hard to say we think it's around 2023 and potentially with some very different trade corridors now moving to the global supply chain during the pandemic companies in the US in Canada in Europe in Australia have all seen their global supply chains being hit due to the lockdown in China and because China is such an important country and part of their global supply chains the pandemic has certainly been a Black Swan event for many supply chain managers now there is a lot of discussions in companies all over the world in terms of how to prepare the supply chain for the new reality for the future how to source how to produce and make and how to distribute goods and of course the overarching question is have we gone true too far when it comes to just-in-time very cost efficient supply chains on the expense of resilience as many companies have have been in a situation where they simply couldn't meet them during the pandemic Carol what do you think this is the million dollar questions will we see more regionalized supply chains going forward due to the pandemic memory as you said business leaders are now are facing a new set of trade-offs between resilience and the efficiency between just in time versus just in case over the decades we have moved towards global supply chain to maximize efficiency and the cost advantage as a result there are a few global manufacturing hubs China is definitely one of them and the largest one the North America Mexico right it's also an important one in Europe we have a Germany as a manufacturing hub an important one as well if the question is are we fundamentally shifting away from the existing global manufacturing hub my opinion is no I don't think so for a couple of very simple reasons number one these places from a demand side are also the largest the markets globally right us of course Germany neo a very important market and China today it was ready the number one consumption market globally and continue to gain a relative importance so I don't see a scenario we do decouple you know the supply you know from the demand side and secondly over the years right this place is beautifui robust and very efficient ecosystem the supplier base the infrastructure the highly skilled labor is also very difficult from efficiency perspective you know to to move away so I actually think you know these are Hopf bases in a will will be here to stay but they will of course be adjustment and you know changes and the regionalized supply chain as you mentioned is one of the trend is one of the transfer but I hope you know these adjustment are made based on the right reasons for the right product I can see a few legitimate reasons for the labor-intensive industry they're already shifting towards a you know a lower even lower cost and countries right you know I think that's in a while the reasons and second this pandemic pandemic searching exposed some of the vulnerable abilities I in the supply chain you know for example essential medical supply right for essential medical supply in the pandemic situation of course now just in case is probably more important than just in time so that pacification you know even some duplication and the building of a human tree buffer you know these need to be assaults true and also another reason I think the legitimate is more for sustainability in a crime a reason right to have a shorter in the transportation supply chance and that's also helped with the climate situation so these in my view are possible adjustment and for the legitimate reasons what frustrate business leader sometimes and adds the complexity the uncertainty you know as well as the cost is more geopolitical issues treat war technology war and these two consumers into Cup two companies are all about adding you know cost and resilience I agree is important is about it has an element of diversification but resilience I think part of that it's also about trust and the global collaboration yes you're so right Carolyn when I was studying the global trade flows and trying to understand what we've seen is actually that we already before the pandemic have started to see some movements in some of the global corridors due to the trade discussions that are happening at a global level so you're absolutely right we can see that in the flows and also as you are saying many of the developments that that is taking place now was already started the discussions around sustainability and how to digitize the supply chain and diverse diversified the pandemic has probably just pushed these and make the made those discussions more urgent never thanks for sharing care Sharon from a u.s. perspective are you in sort of the same discussions global supply chains regional supply chains how to secure supply yeah absolutely absolutely let me pick up on a couple of things both you my bread and carol have said so first of all in terms of shifting of the supply chain you know I think in a lot of respects it's it's not so easy you know to do that in in the short term so so let me talk a little bit about pharmaceuticals so if you look at the pharmaceutical industry it has a very global supply chain but if you look at some of the requirements of that as Carol said the the workforce is very skilled and so it's a skilled workforce it takes months to train them the turnover in terms of the pharmaceutical industry manufacturing workforce is quite high because the working conditions are tough and so under normal circumstances if you wanted to increase the capacity in that workforce it would take three to six months to de training under a Kovach circumstance you can imagine what that takes so there are challenges you know if you look at at the US and you look at the FDA list of drugs that there were shortages of precoded there are a hundred and fifty drugs on that list so there were pre-existing conditions in terms of some supply chain weakness I think they have to be addressed you look at the pharmaceutical supply chain again and it's four to six months longer then then a consumer product supply chain okay and so so that right there introduces some risks so I think you know going forward there's going to be a rethinking through of that I think at the local level there's an opportunity for better sharing so even just sharing of information across hospital systems at the distributor level which would allow for redistribution of inventory I think there's also an opportunity you know coming back to Carol's point around climate and there's an opportunity in terms of actually using less and so how could you do that telemedicine so telemedicine has really taken off under this covent environment for obvious reasons I actually a continuation of telemedicine where appropriate could actually reduce the burden on the overall supply chain I think another opportunity is flexible manufacturing and that would allow you to sort of increases of capacity nearer to say Carol mentioned actually carrying more stock and just having a little bit more security in the supply chain and I agree that's something that both companies and governments are looking into you then I think Margaret you you alluded to this notion of a control tower and I think actually having the ability to look end-to-end a clock across the supply chain in a digital way from the manufacturer all the way through to the consumer and then also being able to model that is quite appropriate and I think something that companies and governments are doing more of and need to continue to do because in that way you can understand both the critical path and the key vulnerabilities of your supply chain so I think that is a trend that will be a continued trend in the future thanks for sharing Sharon so we're seeing definitely continuation of some of the big forces that we're taking place in in global supply chain strategy precoded if we look at the next 12 to 18 months the future looks still very uncertain and we don't know unfortunately whether we will hit a second wave of the pandemic when it comes to the autumn and the winter and companies across sectors are of course preparing for this here in Europe one of the discussions that I had with one of my clients which is a global consumer products company is how to prepare for that and we are discussing exactly the control tower that you mentioned share on how to build into and visibility and really understand the supply chain and on not only our supply chain and our suppliers but actually understanding the suppliers suppliers to figure out where do we have risks in our supply chain and how concentrated is our network and whether we should do make a bio decisions of course that's a little bit longer term than 12 months but this control tower was a path that many companies were on already before the cove it and it's of course built on on digital tools and big data on top of that we are discussing how to build a digital twin so meaning we are building a virtual supply chain to figure out and stress test as you also mentioned Sharon if we will have another Black Swan event and test different scenarios how would our supply then how would be what would it be our ability to supply in which regions and what are then the actions we want to take to increase for example safety levels in our stock Carol in China and elsewhere what in your region what is the discussion right now from a 12 to 18 months perspective I think oh oh there's a digital and new tus technology and then a bode new supply chain ideas so very much relevant here you know in China you know we are we are fairly advanced in the digital economy on the to see and in a to consumer however on the you know to be smart manufacturing smart supply chain there's still a lot of room for improvement you know I think one thing the covert in abroad is every government is using a stimulus package to reduce the economy and in China that the package is called an hour new infrastructure investment a lot to do with 5g a lot to do with the data center with AI technology in Ibiza we are hoping to give a big boost on infrastructure as well as in capability by using all this digital juice because even looking beyond 12 to 18 months right you know we see some of the new trends or new consumer behavior you know will will will stay one thing we discussed in the early episodes really the acceleration towards online o to our channel on digital channel for consumer buying behavior and that has new challenges for the supply chain as well you know using one example in the Beauty category and something very close to our heart in your skincare and cosmetics and now you know digital or online is not just one the channels actually becomes a main or even a dominant channel for certain product categories but the consumers behavior is quite different in an online channels and they're very much associated brand with hero as kayuu's so in the past and off my channel maybe 20% of your SKU represent 60 to 70% of your volume but online may be less than 10% already represent 80% of your your volume less than 10% sko 80% of volume and also it's very you know event based right in China is a famous singles day you know 618 you know international women day here we call the Queen's Day you know these has a huge spike you know on demand so that has a lot of a new challenge for some and many of the tools you mentioned control tower digital tween you know will play a very important role wow it's so vibrant and yeah I continue to be amazed on how far China is actually ahead of some other markets when it comes to the digital consumer it's really interesting and very strategic questions for the supply chain Carol thanks a lot Sharon from a u.s. perspective looking at the next 12 to 18 months what's what's top of mind their supply chain Weis many things are top of mind I think I think one thing that hasn't yet been mentioned but I think a lot of government entities are doing is is really thinking about this the supplier risk so really honing in on what are key product categories that we have to ensure we have enough quantity of and and doing an assessment of those categories against a lot of different dimensions and then putting together a plan that thinks through okay so what can we do to ensure that we have enough of the in these categories and so it's basic things but it's important things it's like placing orders more in advance so you have longer lead times it's actually incentivizing producers through early payment to actually deliver things in a more timely fashion it's establishing alternate vendors and so really thinking about the next 12 months because you can't fix the supply chain in the next 12 months what are the levers that you can pull to ensure that there's resilience and and fortitude in terms of the overall supply chain so that is that is what some governments here are certainly thinking through again a very strategic question by category level in terms of preparing for for the unknown basically thanks for sharing that Sharon well taking a step back the pandemic is certainly a very awful health crisis which has led to an economic crisis but if we want to look at the positive side I think this discussion today has Illustrated that there is a lot of opportunities coming out of the kovat in during further digital acceleration and transformation of the supply chain lots of interesting questions for leadership to work with around the world thanks for being here with me today I look forward to our discussion next week [Music]"}, {"id": "N-YMusEs37E",

"10:34", "views": 19231, "published": "1 year ago", "transcript": " what do we mean when we talk about the consulting industry consulting is a word that has been used so much more in the business world part of this is because it has grown so rapidly over the past 20 to 25 years now there's a big difference between describing some of the work McKinsey Bain and BCG are doing which we'll dig into a little more and some of the other work that smaller players are or firms that are implementing technology solutions so we'll walk through some of the differences and the types of consulting and just talk about what makes the big three McKinsey Bain and BCG a little different the consulting industry has grown rapidly over the past 20 years and has a lot to do with the increased attention that the industry has gotten now in 2016 consultancy dot uk' size the market at about two hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars and also showed that it was growing at a greater than four percent rate annually there's basically five core areas they looked at operations financial technology HR strategy there's some subtle differences between these different areas and we'll dive down a little deeper to what we mean when we say strategy consulting so if we break it down into four different buckets and I've offered some example companies here so we have typical strategy and operations work these are the big firms they might answer a question that a client has such as how do I transform my company in the next five years these are big ambiguous complex problems that these firms are perfectly set up to deliver on with their global teams their deep knowledge infrastructure and their ability to scale up and really focus and dive down on a problem really quickly next is more HR and organization consulting this is often work around designing compensation programs what does it look like we're re our workforce and you have firms like executive search firms who are increasingly getting into this space and helping people with leadership assessments and helping with succession planning third is technology and implementation now this is probably some of the less sexy work of the consulting industry and this might help a client implement a new IT system over several years if anyone's had s AP or Oracle implementations at their company I'm sure there is a company like Accenture IBM behind the scenes helping with the implementation and fourth is an area called due diligence and this is really an assessment of for private equity companies and also mergers and acquisitions groups at big companies of saying how should we think about acquiring companies and then for practically should we buy or not buy this company so these projects tend to be very finite can be two-week projects maybe a little longer maybe a little shorter and are very intensely focused on like how do we understand the customer how do we understand the market and how does this company fit into our broader portfolio coming back to the breakdown of the consulting industry when we talk about strategy consulting in common business language now what are we really talking about we're really focused on three key key areas operations HR and strategy these core areas are typically the high-level problems and companies where the the CEO the board and other senior executives are focused on these areas and our leading major projects or initiatives to transform these areas strategy consulting can break down even further in a really eight core types of work you can have things like corporate strategy this can be work with the board saying what is the strategy it look like over the next three years how should we be thinking about it is our CEO aligned with the vision around this and what's happening in the market next could be something around mergers and this could be helping a company define what are the companies we should be targeting how should we be thinking about making things internally versus buying companies that do things and how should we be thinking about this market as it evolves over time organizational strategy this might look at in organizational redesign you might be moving from a functional set up to a business unit set up more around product you might also be looking at how can you transform the culture globally or at least in a local region next might be operations and this could be looking at how do we plan a supply chain network how do we operate and improve the efficiency of manufacturing plants across the globe how do we think are about our product development cycle and how that operates with engineers and finally an emerging and growing area is digital and this is in the strategy consulting bucket now because it's at the agenda of the CEO and the board everyone's thinking about this companies are thinking about how do we adapt to the future of work how do we think about machine learning technology how do we give employees the tools to do their job from anywhere and how are we accessing new markets with all these platforms and other technologies that exist now there's two buckets of strategy consultants if we break it down even further first is the pure play strategy firms you'll notice that these are typifies by the BC G's McKenzie's and Baynes but there's also some boutique players like AT&T le K Navigon and Oliver Wyman the latter four companies are a bit smaller and more boutique and BCG McKinsey and Bain are becoming massive companies who are operating all around the globe have large teams across most functions of a business and are increasingly entering new spaces like McKinsey with the McKinsey solutions and building tech startups internally to help shape what is the future of consulting look like now I alluded to the fact earlier that a lot of boutique firms don't exist anymore and these firms have been bought up by big four accounting firms and other historical consulting firms like IBM to help those firms broaden the services they offer to their customers and in this space you have firms like Accenture KPMG Ernst and Young these firms do a lot they do technology consulting they do audit work with accounting and are increasingly offering so many services like risk and also have these strategy groups that operate with varying levels of autonomy and independence internally you have firms like the Parthenon group that operates internally at E&Y and you have boozin company that was acquired by PwC that was renamed so what makes the big three different I've looked at this market for a while and there's a number of factors that both make them different in their size and scale of how they compete and how it makes the actual work in the consulting process and the depth of that a little different and basically what we'll be diving into in this course so they make a few operational decisions which really enable them to compete in a different way first and most important is that they charge the highest fees now one of the early influencers in shaping McKinsey and company Marvin Bower talked a lot about charging the high fees as a way to symbol that they were going to signal that they were going to do the best work now charging the highest fees gives the companies the ability to do a number of things it enables consultants to only have to work on one project at a time now add some other boutique firms and other firms in the big four space a lot of times consultants are working on more than one project at a time now this harms and basically makes it more challenging to go as deep as these firms can in terms of a structured problem-solving approach additionally they're also growing quite fast I know BCG has been growing in a crazy clip for the past 10 to 15 years and is always reinvesting more in people and training globally finally they have the most resources dedicated to training they make conscious choices about sending people to training for two weeks they take them out of the office and say this is all you need to worry about for two weeks and go super deep on what those problem solving processes are for at McKinsey I went through several full week trainings which were really intense and often times harder than some of the work I was doing during the working week but in each of those experiences you're getting hands-on coaching from other consultants and really at the end of the week in the weeks following the training you get the sense that you were able to level up your skills"}]
