months ago", "transcript": " hi my name is Chris Segura and welcome to another episode of Block Talk today I'm joined by my colleague Mike Walker Mike\nI want to introduce yourself thank you for having me so my name is Mike Walker\nI'm in the Applied Innovation group and what we do is we do some interesting\nthings with our customers where we help our more on the business side help them\nunderstand how to use all these great emerging technologies and as you can\nimagine blockchain is the most hyped technology on the planet so that comes\nup in discussion quite a bit yeah right so really I help organizations soul\nsearch really where they want to go with these technologies and move past the\nhype and focus on real business outcomes with these technologies awesome so in\nyour discussions I imagine there's kind of sort of common patterns that come up\nover and over right can you sort of help us sort of what are the patterns you see\nfor maybe in the past maybe in the future what's common for you guys\nabsolutely and so since this technology is so hyped there's a lot of\nmisconceptions and so some of the major trends and I keep it simple for our\ndiscussion today but there's really three core trends that that I see in the\nmarketplace first and foremost is there is a general fatigue around these\ntechnologies and cxos whether it be a CIO fatigue in terms of too many\nacronyms too much hype not enough delivery delivery it's more the latter\nright so it's yeah there's with our world there's always going to be you\nknow acronym suit however really it's about we see all this POC activity chart\nand now we have a lot of delivery of real solutions and so you know really\nyou know how I like to look at this is practical blockchain implementations and\nthat's really kind of the core first trend is companies are quickly shifting\n- okay yeah I gotta get that in MVP out but with that MVP is that MVP leading to\nsomething that's going to of a legitimate business problem and not\njust solve the problem yes this technology is legitimate yes we're past\nthat point now and you know if we believe our analyst friends you know\nWeatherby Forrester or Gardner you know we're moving in you know past\nhype cycles and all that great stuff so now it's about producing real results\nand so that's the first key trend that I see is you know moving past the POC and\ngetting practical awesome mmm second it's realizing that when we start to\ntalk about these technologies practically now we start to talk in\nterms of solutions and realizing that with blockchain solutions blockchain is\nactually a small percentage of the overall solution it's a critical\ncomponent of the solution however it may only be 10 or 20% of the overall\nsolution I think in this show we've always said blockchain is really a\ntechnology it's not a solution right it's a component of a solution but it by\nitself a ledger doesn't do anything you have to connect it to other things to\ngain value to gain insights and so what we see is kind of a second major trend\nis really convergence so it's convergence of three emerging\ntechnologies to build compelling solutions and those three are blockchain\nproviding a foundational data service capability that allows us to move past\ntraditional databases that were built for companies they weren't built for\necosystems they were built for peer-to-peer data sharing right\nthey weren't also built for mastering data at least very well without having a\nwhole separate stack and solution and so blockchain is a really great way of\ndoing that but also in today's world we see a lot in the news our governments\nand regulations around things like data sovereignty and data privacy and those\nare key capabilities baked into blockchain that we should talk more\nabout when we're talking with our business partners so it's blockchain\nproviding those capabilities but also what our company is trying to do today\nthey're trying to digitize they're trying to move from the analog to the\ndigital and so IOT starts to come into picture as the bridge into those worlds\nlinking into blotching to master that data provide audit ability and\ntraceability etc and then third leg of that stool is\nputting intelligence around all of that and understanding that we live in a\nworld where you know this year Gartner says there's going to be twenty billion\nIOT sensors out in a while well all these sensors are talking to each other\nit doesn't matter who it's made from when it's talking to it everything's\ntalking to everything else and there needs to be intelligence wrapped around\nthat so we see is a second key trend is really the convergence convergence of\nthose three technologies because there is a lot of serendipity between all\nthose technologies and working well against so how do you see like for\nexample so I have IOT data jet or I am IOT devices generating data about their\nenvironment around them you have AI and ML sort of gaining intelligence\ndelivering knowledge from that data where does blockchain sort of wrap these\ntwo together or is it on top is it around how do these two work together so\nthe cool thing here is one of the key challenges with AI will talk about AI\nfor a second will move in to IOT with AI it's one of these things garbage in\ngarbage out yep right and so if I don't have good trustworthy data I'm not gonna\nhave really good intelligence right or I'll have misleading and biased Intel\nscience yeah and so where blockchain comes in is it can master that IOT data\nit can master other sources data that's hand entered scanned whatever it may be\nand so that's one of the key benefits that blockchain is going to bring back\nto AI for I of T it's about the tracking and Trust right so if I'm in a scenario\nwhere I'm in a highly regulated world let's say I'm I want to prevent an e\ncoli outbreak right yes I've got IT sensors on the lettuce\nis it the right IOT sensor did someone do something fraudulent was a remand in\nthe middle attack you know can I have a digital signature that essentially can\nattest that yes authoritative lis this was the device you know that had sent\nthis particular data to that blocking and it's immutable etc yeah and we bring\nall that together and we see real real world solutions where we've got a a\nfactory floor and we've got issues where people are\nretiring and so you've got new folks coming in that don't have the\ninstitutional knowledge of the past 30 40 years but also we're shifting from\npaper to digital well we've got that convergence of all these different\nfactors and where these three technologies are going to be able to\nhelp me in a very tangible way is I've got IOT that's able to say of these\ndevices and how I should interact I've got maybe a augmented reality or virtual\nreality or mixed reality that's intersecting with those IOT sensors now\nthat's able to provide that mixed reality scenario with blockchain to say\nyes this is true authoritative data all right and then\nI've got AI ml that's automating the repetitive tasks for me where I am a\nSarah to do this so you can kind of see in these scenarios where it's very very\ncomplimentary yeah yeah absolutely we do talk about that quite often and our\npresentations when we meet with customers where a trade shows in fact we\ndo the supply chain scenario quite often because it is a good sort of convergence\nof all three technologies the IOT data taking information about ice cream\ntaking information about lettuce ai gaining intelligence from that in the\nblockchain data sort of providing that trust but verify layer right you gave me\nthis data great we can always come back regardless of how long it's been and\ncome back and say this was the data we had we satisfied conditions of our smart\ncontract we satisfied other data we move on this is how we do business together\nand in my mind it's really the codification of our business process\nthat blockchain is really sort of helping sort of put these two\ntechnologies together I think it's great and here's another thing that oftentimes\nwe don't think about is data quality how much time do we spend with integration\nand cleaning of our data in a reactive night watching gets in front of all that\nessentially what we're doing is we have that smart contract as soon as you put\ndata into that blockchain is validate it's it's purified so are those back-end\nreconciliation processes that we have whether it be and our finance\norganizations or in other areas in our organization those start to go on the\nendangered species list right just naturally by using these technologies\ntogether all right cool now third key trend and we've alluded to it\nwith the other two is all around digital ecosystems sometimes it's referred to as\nblockchain consortiums that's a tricky word you know when when I talk with you\nknow cxos and we mentioned the word blockchain consortiums there's some\nthings that come up in their mind that consortium has prior art in the legal\nindustry it means certain things and we don't necessarily mean that war no no we\ndon't at all so we have to be very careful but also I think it does this a\ndisservice to blockchain and what we're trying to accomplish so that's why I've\nbeen using the word Moore ecosystem and you'll see you know Gartner calls them\nbusiness ecosystems I call them digital ecosystems because\nthat's really what we're doing is we haven't we already have ecosystems today\nbut largely they're analog and they're prone with all sorts of manual processes\nand really what we're trying to do is we're trying times internally when we\nrefer to ecosystem we mean actually something different often we use that to\nrepair as partners when you're using ecosystem you kind of mean a little bit\nof everything right partners customers people that are doing some sort of\nbusiness together yeah in various ways we're transacting together you're an\noutcome that's a good yep and it could be a partner it could be a device mmhmm\nright it could be lots of different things and knowing that we are in a\nworld which is you know I'll go to kind of the Business School definition we see\nmulti-sided businesses where the days of a buyer-seller relationship those days\nare gone is much more complicated there it's buyer-seller data aggregator that\ngets sold to an end user that end user then is able to monetize that you can\nkind of see how the spider webs out and so the traditional binary relationships\nstart to go away and that's why it's so important to kind of call what it is\nwhich is we live in these ecosystems and we build a business model around these\necosystems and so with this third trend around digital ecosystems the the actual\ntrend is understanding that one there our digital ecosystems - not all digital\necosystems are the same and we should create these ecosystems that are fit for\npurpose and so you've got three major types you've got a founder led model\nwhich is really all about saying I've got one company that's going to create a\npermission blockchain and they're gonna control it and it and it may be from a\ncompetitive perspective they want to do that or it might be a regulatory\nperspective give you a great example I was in Tel Aviv about nine months ago\nand I'm sitting down with the CTO for the city and we're talking about their\nblotching implementation for the lights and you know street lights it's really\nyou know the electricity and all that great stuff and I said so you know so\nit's permissioned it's private etc etc you know so tell me you know will it\nalways be that way of course why would we we're saving a bunch of money this\njust makes sense we don't need these other requirements so we're not going to\ndo that yeah okay let's find for some scenarios and maybe it's a part of your\njourney as well maybe it's the first evolutionary step to improve an idea but\nalso we see other models like a partnership driven model where you've\ngot two major organizations that join a essentially a joint venture and do it\ntogether the governance and the architecture looks different there and\nthen you've got kind of true quote-unquote consortiums that are more\nindustry driven in the industry driven ones we actually see the smallest\npercentage believe it or not in this blockchain world in that category in the\nreason why is it so hard I was just gonna ask that yep and it's hard enough\nto get your business executives your lawyers your risk management people your\ninformation security people all to agree now imagine timesing that by ten or if\nthis is a point in time limitation meaning the industry is just young its\ngrowing this will solve over time is it a technology problem would I think it's\nall the above and I think it's one a lot of its hey we're just not ready and with\nlots of big organizations they want to mitigate as much risk possible and so\nthey're like if someone's willing to try this\nand incubate this for a little while we're gonna let them do that and then\nwe'll kind of get involved number one so that could be a scenario to technology\nwise it's tricky watching is still evolving as a technology and we still\nhave issues around across cloud across ledger\noh yeah compatibility we talked earlier about tokens and the compatibility there\nso we've got lots of technical challenges they're overcome a bowl but\nthey're hard and it requires a lot of deliberate architectural work to address\nthose but I think third and most importantly is the commercial model\naround these yeah and so oftentimes what these blockchain ecosystems require is a\nlevel of co-op cooperation from their competitors and as you know until\ncapitalism dies it's really hard to tell your shareholders never a legitimate way\nright it's very hard to say hey we're going to erode our margins because we\nwant to play well with our competitors that doesn't fly often times so we got\nto be very realistic and very practical here that we are you know try to\nmonetize these services there will be things we're working together outweighs\nsome of these factors but you know we are very much living in a world where\ncompanies are competing and so we have to be aware of that and so with these\ndigital ecosystems what you'll find is it's not as clear-cut as kind of one\nblotching to rule them all we actually see layers or a chain of chain type of\narchitecture where you might have for a business process let's say an insurance\nyou've got the risk stream Alliance which takes a small subset of claims\ndata from all the insurance company and puts it on a blockchain well the special\nsauce so that's only like five to ten data fields as an example the hundred\ndata fields of all the transactional history and all that is actually kept by\nthe insurance companies and they've got their own blockchain implementations and\nthey're linked together for making sure that we're all using the right data\nhowever they're doing interesting things behind the scenes in their organization\nso it's not as simple as hey we've got one style but there will be multiple\nstyles that will be linked together across these ecosystem and I\nthink a great sort of highlight to the point you're making there is when you're\ntalking about sort of the digitization of your business the digitization of\nyour business process you look at something like the supply chain which\nmight start out very simple I sell parts to you you build them into something\nbigger better more interesting that process though in reality we do business\ntogether maybe we cooperate maybe we compete together who knows but then\neventually that same thing that gets you built to get shipped to somebody else\nand there may be insurance on that because it may be a high-value asset so\nnow you have another business process that comes in another partner another\nsort of contortion member if you alright so yeah I think these are sort of really\nsuper interesting discussions around how does business how does technology how\ndoes the industry grow and it's great insight to see where we're at now in\n2020 it's still pretty young right we're still at the beginning of this journey\nand I would say this isn't exclusive to blockchain this is the whole notion of\ndigitizing my enterprise we're still very young on that transformation\njourney shala and so we've got the business models and\nhow to think about this evolving we got the technology evolving we've got a\nworkforce where we've got an influx of new talent coming into the workforce\nwe've got an aging population that's working longer so there's all these\nfactors that are making a really really interesting time to be working through\nthese these particular issues and into your supply chain comment you know I'm\nworking right now with there's a case study about this on Microsoft comm with\nGE aviation yeah and I've been working very closely with their executives and I\nwas actually very very surprised to find out for just their kind of core Aviation\nsupply chain there's 21,000 independent data points yeah this is complex yes\nthat's a fascinating application too if you haven't highly recommend you look up\nthat case study because it is fascinating application great example of\nboth the benefits of this technology and some of the reasons people are looking\nat it to solve problems that they haven't been able to solve prior Mike\nthank you for joining us it's been a fantastic\ndiscussion yeah absolutely anytime yeah great thanks for joining us today\nagain for more discussions around business side more discussions on the\ntechnology side continue to watch us on channel 9 at the blog talk show or\nfollow us on Twitter at MSFT blockchain thanks a lot you"}, {"id": "a1Vacckr_ms", "link":

"transcript": " in this video I'm gonna talk about one of the biggest trends in blockchain for 2020 people ask me all the time where is blockchain headed what are people actually using it for well that's exactly what I'm gonna talk about in this video I'm gonna show you where I think we're gonna see big growth in 2020 and also give you a list of several projects that you should keep your eye on so before I do that if you're new around here hey I'm Gregory from DAP university on this channel I teach you how to become a blockchain developer so if that's something that you're interested in then click the like button down below and click Subscribe and also if you've been watching this channel for a while don't forget my brand new program blockchain mastery University comes out on January 29th you can click the link down below to sign up so what do I think is the biggest trend in blockchain for 2020 decentralized finance or defy for short so what is it well basically dphi is taking traditional financial products and just porting them over to the blockchain things like savings loans derivatives I expect this trend to continue on through the rest of 2020 so there's two big reasons I think this all right number one is historical growth so if you look at this curve right ever since 2017 we saw a huge explosion and then just consistent steady growth throughout the last two years and I don't think this is gonna stop anytime soon simply because of all the innovation and adoption that's happening in the ecosystem alright so the other big reason is just use cases and where the users actually are so one of the original use cases for blockchain technology at all was cryptocurrency and one of the big reasons people used it in the first place was because it provided benefits they couldn't achieve somewhere else like financial speculation you can get big gains with cryptocurrency that you couldn't find other places you could also you know make transactions with cryptocurrency outside of the traditional financial system which is another big benefit for people so defy is just a continuation of these use cases and it serves the needs of people who are already using the blockchain it has users baked in already so now in addition to trading and holding and buying stuff they can get loans and do a lot more and here's one of the big reasons I think Defy is going to continue to grow through 2020 it might even accelerate because it's providing new benefits and use cases that you can't get some or else what if you could earn five to 10% interest by just parking your money somewhere right well you can't do that in your bank account but you can do it with d5 projects what if you could get a loan without having to get pre-approved by a bank you're gonna do it with d5 projects what if we could get to the point where we essentially just streamline house purchases right you get a loan you could actually buy the house that would be a game-changing benefit of blockchain technology so how does d5 work well basically it combines together different blockchain mechanisms to achieve the kinds of benefits that I've talked about things like smart contracts and cryptocurrencies so companies use these to develop dphi protocols and what's really cool about these protocols is a lot of times they can be combined together to achieve new benefits and for this reason sometimes people call d5 money Legos because you can just plug these things in together and build new things which is a really exciting proposition for developers now let's see how dphi works in practice we'll look at the example of savings and loans in order to earn high interest savings you could use a protocol like a compound finance you can use a currency like dye for example it's call of a stable currency because it's price doesn't change and you can lock it into this protocol and earn a high savings rate usually higher than you would in your bank account and now let's talk about loans because that's the other half of the equation how can you get a defy alone without getting pre-approved by a bank you do this by giving collateral in order to take out a loan in most cases you offer one cryptocurrency as collateral and you borrow a different cryptocurrency as a loan this is primarily used by cryptocurrency traders because their collateralizing one cryptocurrency and borrowing a different one because they expect the price to change and they want to make a profit off of this arbitrage opportunity and that's how this protocol works you're able to earn high interest savings because it's lending money out on the other side and the entire time it has all these funds can locked up in the middle and that's a lot like how a regular bank works this just does it programmatically with smart contracts on the blockchain and I think a real dphi explosion could happen whenever we find a way to make uncollateralized loans in the blockchain basically finding a way to issue loans without people having to give up some kind of collateral to begin with that's how most credit cards work you know normally when you apply for a credit card you don't have to give something in order to get a credit card you typically just need a credit score so maybe we can find a way to implement a credit score on the blockchain or some kind of reputation system that makes this possible that's what I would like to see so as somebody comes out with a project like that in 2020 we could see some big growth and adoption so where is this space headed in 2020 are we gonna see new breakthroughs like that happen well I would love to see for those types of things to happen but we'll have to wait and see there's a lot of barriers we have to overcome but the good news is there's a lot of upside potential in this space there's so much room for innovation but before we get too excited I'll tell you what probably won't happen in 2020 I don't think that we're gonna see your grandmother using d5 protocols I doubt that she's just gonna download an app and start holding her money in a crypto wallet to earn a high interest savings I think we have a long way to go before that type of things started to happen but I do think we could eventually get there if some of the key problems are solved at the core of d5 that provides benefits in ways that are tangible for everyday users and are accessible and I know there are a lot of people who are just waiting for blockchain technology to explode overnight so I would be surprised if we saw something like that in 2020 but hey I could be wrong and I would be glad to be proven wrong on something like that and now I want to bring up another perspective which is somewhat of a criticism of the d-phi space that I hear a lot they say defy isn't really decentralized right and they offer a better term they want to call it open fire or something else like that which I'm ok with I think that makes sense right to me decentralization is a sliding scale all the way from completely decentralized to completely centralized usually the best value for the end-user is gonna be somewhere in the middle even if there are some centralized components of this there's still this added benefit of transparency and C I think transparency is a huge value of blockchain technology in the long run especially for projects that value their reputation even if they have centralized parts of their business parts of their technology there's still a value in transparency because if they fail or they do something nefarious then you know exactly where and when it happened and you know who to blame this introduces accountability into the system and is really good for projects who value their reputation in the long term not so much for sketchy projects but for reputable project it does and it puts pressure on them to act honestly even if they're still centralized parts of their technology so if you want to keep a close watch on the defy ecosystem I highly recommend checking out d5 pulse comm you can track the total volume of US dollar that's moving through dphi projects and you can also see you know a list of top projects here and explore and find ways that you can achieve these kind of benefits that I've talked about you can see products that I just mentioned here like compound finance and also maker and I think what I'm going to do is actually make a follow-up video to this one where I take a deep dive into some of these projects and tell you how they fit together how you can use these money Legos and achieve these benefits like high interest savings and loans and also find ways that you can on board new users who haven't used the blockchain before so that they can reap these benefits and this could highlight a road towards blockchain adoption so subscribe to the channel and check out that next video when it comes out and if you have subscribed and been watching this channel for awhile then

"published": "2 years ago", "transcript": " >> We'll get started. So, this is the session\non Blockchains, so welcome to this session\non Blockchains. So, we have a bunch of interesting\ntalks in this session. Our first presentation\nwill be on a work that marries traditional\ndatabases with Blockchain. The second work would be\non exploring how we can use computation verification in the setting of Blockchain. Then finally we have another work that explores how we can use enclaves to kind of achieve better performance\nand confidentiality in the context of Blockchains. So, the first speaker\nis going to be Professor Carsten Binnig from Technical University\nof Darmstadt. He's also an adjunct professor at Brown University and before that he was an architect\nat SAP HANA. He's a recipient of Google Faculty Award and he has a bunch of Best Paper\nAwards at IEEE, Big Data and VLDB and SIGMOD and he's been\nrecently exploring the overlap between Blockchains and databases and he's\ngoing to talk about that. >> Wonderful. Good.\nDo you hear me? So, the mic should be on. So, today, as Arvind mentioned, I'm talking about a database\nview on Blockchains. So, my main research is\nactually, in general, in distributed\ndatabases, especially distributed databases\ntogether with networks. So, I'm a database person. Just to give you a quick\nintroduction where I come from. So, why I got interested\nin Blockchains is because people are not using Blockchains for\ncryptocurrencies only, but they use Blockchains\nmore and more for general shared databases, to write data into from one trusted domain and access it from\nanother trusted domain. The main reason why\npeople are using it as a platform for data sharing is, there are many different reasons. One is because it keeps\nthe history of all transactions. Meaning, if something is\nwrong in your database, you can go back and still\nlook at what went wrong. In some states in the USA, they even changed the laws\nthat blockhains or the data in Blockchain counts\nas evidence in court, which is a strong reason\nif you share data between different\ntrusted domains. The second one is why\nit's interesting is also because no tampering\nis possible after-the-fact. So, once the transaction is in, you cannot modify the list of transactions you store\nin your Blockchain. Even more interesting, you\ndon't need a trusted authority for making all these decisions. So, the machinery and Blockchain\nis designed in order to give you the two properties, that it stores all transactions\nand it doesn't allow tampering without having\na trusted authority. So, and you see that it's actually used as\nshared databases and there are many applications outside that try actually to use Blockchains already\nas a shared database. They range from different\nor cover different domains, not data, just in from\nhealth institutions, but also supply chains where\nyou have different entities, the supplier and the manufacturer requiring to access\nthe same database. But also to other use\ncases where you want to have decentralized\ncopyright management. So, for example, Binded is a copyright management\nplatform for images where you\nput in the image, it gets a timestamp and\nthus it has the copyright, and if somebody else at the end wants to upload\nanother similar image, you have to prove\nthat the other image was in the database before. So, the question is\nnow, are we done now? Is this the end of the talk? So, are existing\nBlockchain systems, is they are good\nenough for supporting all the different applications\nthat people have in mind and when they want to use\nthem as a shared database? So, what I'm going to do\nin the talk is, therefore, I'm first going quickly- I think most of the people might\nknow the Blockchain basics, but I'll still go quickly over\nthe Blockchain background, some basic terms that I'm not talking about things that are out of context in\nthe rest of the talk, then talk about the challenges why Blockchains, in my eyes, are not sufficient\nyet to use them as a shared database and\nthen go towards what we've been doing in the past year with Blockchain to be developing a shared or Database\nSystem on top of Blockchains that mitigate some of the problems that we've seen, or that I am going\nto discuss before. So, for Blockchains,\njust the quick overview, I don't want to\nspend too much time. So, Blockchains\nthe basis they use, a tamper-proof ledger\nto store data, which I already\nmentioned, it's a list of transactions, it's append only. The transactions are\nappended in blocks, so if new data is written, the new data is appended or mined in blocks and the ledger\nis fully replicated. Here you see already, if something is mined or appended in blocks and\nit's fully replicated, there seems to be a lot\nof inefficiency in the system itself and this is, again, one of the challenges\nthat you tackle when you want to use it as a\ngeneral-purpose Database System. So, why it's so interesting\nas a shared database, I already mentioned is, if an update happened to\nthe shared database, which is replicated to\nall the peers in the Blockchain, then everybody or\nat least the majority depending on what protocol you're using is to agree on the appends and there are\ndifferent ways to assure that, nevermind what you\nare using, if you're using a public\nor private Blockchain. That's what also we will\ngo over in a few seconds. The last bit of piece\nof information that I'd like to introduce is\nthe term smart contracts, which are nothing else\nthan trusted procedures that are stored in the\nBlockchain that can modify data. It's your custom logic that\nyou deploy in a Blockchain. For database person, it\nwould be something like a stored procedure that can\nbe called from outside. But for smart contracts, the specific thing is\nthat all the participants agree on the same code if\nyou're on the Blockchain. The second slide, just to\nget the background right, there are two platforms or ways how Blockchains\nare deployed. There are public Blockchains, means that everybody,\nevery participant, can join the Blockchain and they usually use more expensive\nconsensus protocols. I won't go into\ndetails for those, but just to make sure that\nwe're on the same side, there are also\nprivate Blockchains, which target a different type\nof application where not everybody is allowed to join the Blockchain but\nit's more limited set, targeted towards a limited set of participants that\nknow each other. Therefore, they use a bit of less expensive consensus\nprotocols and this already increases\nthe performance a bit when you use Blockchains\nas a Database System. So, the question is, that's where I'd actually\nlike to start my talk, what are the challenges\nif you want to use a Blockchains as\na shared Database System? The main challenge, I\nalready mentioned that, is clearly the performance\nof Blockchains. There was a paper last year\non SIGMOD where they analyzed the throughput and the latency of different Blockchain systems. One is Ethereum, that\nis pretty well-known, which you can set up as\na public but also as a private Blockchain,\nas well as Hyperledger, which is the IBM version\nof Blockchain system. But what you see here is that the throughput, for example, for a classical\ndatabase benchmarks, so if you use the Blockchains as a key-value store,\nit's pretty low. So, they reported\naround, for Ethereum, around 300 transactions per\nsecond that can be executed. If you look carefully\nin the paper, this is not the average\ntransaction rate, that's the peak transaction rate. So, the average transaction rate is actually much, much lower. So, clearly here you see that the transaction and\nthe performance that you get, the transaction rate,\nthe throughput and the latency\nthat you get out of these Blockchains is far from what typical\napplications need today. Even, for example, if you look at what Visa is\nprocessing on average, so Visa transactions are around 2,000\ntransactions per second. If you look into the applications how people want to\nuse Blockchains, they also want to store\nsensor data in the Blockchain, which even require much higher\ntransaction rates. So, the performance\nitself is one problem. The second one is, if you today want to use one of\nthe Blockchain systems to set up a shared database, you are confronted with the\n\"zoo\" of those systems, and it's really not\nclear which one to use. They come, (a) with different programming\nand execution models, and the question is with which platform are you able\nto implement your logic that you want to have\nfor the shared database. Where can you implement? In which can you implement transactions or the transaction logic that\nis needed for use case. Even worse, because there's\nso much development going on, you don't know what is\nthe best Blockchain for your workload and (b) which ones will\nsurvive at the end, because there's\nso much movement in the sector and people are trying to\ncome up with optimizations, new platforms and it's unclear which one you should build your shared\ndatabase application on. The last one is even more\nsevere, that Blockchains, you might assume if you deploy your code in the\nBlockchain and run it, you get some kind- because even procedures run through\nthe consensus mechanism that multiple nodes need to execute the same code bases\nand at the end the output of\nthe procedure is verified, so meaning if\nall the outputs are equal. But that's not true\nfor purely read only functions that you would implement in your smart contract. They are only executed by\none peer in the Blockchain. Meaning, if that one peer, if that one node, is malicious and you\nare asking or you're sending a read request\nto that one peer, you might get a wrong value\nfrom the peer end. So, the guarantees we are\ngetting for reads, for example, is not enough for many of the shared database\nwhere you want to know, is the value I've\nbeen reading actually the value that is\nstored in the database? So, there are\nmany guarantees that you actually then want to add to your Database System or to your, if you use your Blockchain\nas a shared database, and what we think would be nice is if you could execute transactions on\na shared Blockchain, at the end verify if the\nexecution of the transaction, meaning if all your read and\nwrite operations was correct with regard to the guarantees what the database wants to give you, and if you discover that\na violation happened, that you can go back to\nthe last verified checkpoint. So, the ideas of\ntransactional theory more into implemented in Blockchains, but also transactions\nthat are verifiable. So, how are we going\nto achieve this? This is the idea of BlockchainDB. The idea is that we built a Middleware on top\nof Blockchains. The idea is what\nthe BlockchainDB gives us is that it gives\nus a unified API. So, we tackle the problem of having a sue of those systems by having a unified front-end and an exchangeable back-end, similar to what MySQL is today. For databases, you get\na unified front-end and you can plug in your storage\nengine that you like to have, which gives you the\nperformance characteristics maybe that you want to\nhave for your application. The second one is\nthat we can apply typical database optimizations\nin the Middleware. So, we've seen that the performance itself\nis a major limitation, and by applying some tricks\nin the Middleware, by sharding across\ncertain Blockchains, we can achieve much higher\nthroughput than what the existing Blockchains\ngive us already. The last one is that\nwe want to support this notion of\nverifiable transactions. So, executing read/write\noperations via the BlockchainDB, and then at the end getting a verification mechanism\nthat tells us is a transaction that we've executed been correct with regard to the consistency level, for example, selected\nin the Database System? Now you could argue,\n\"Okay, a BlockchainDB, this is the component that runs outside of your Blockchain. So, it's an untrusted component, doesn't it make things harder?\" I'll come to that at the end and I'll talk a bit about how we deal with verification with a new component that\nis actually untrusted. So, what we've\nactually been building in the last year is not\na full Database System, but as a first step, we started to build\na Middleware that has a simple put/get interface\nbecause this is already from, as a basic building block, we think we can use later on to build transactions on top, and b, it gives us already proof of concept of how far can we get with transaction rates\nif you have just a simple put/get workload. So, the idea is we have a Blockchain key-value\nstore that supports at the beginning only the simple put/get operations\nthat we have here and we have pluggable back-ends. Inside the Blockchain,\nin order to achieve the higher performance and implement some database\noptimizations, we selected a bunch of techniques that are implemented\nin the Middleware, be it from sharding, the data into\nmultiple Blockchains, so not using just one. This is a thing that already\nsome of the Blockchains do by now inside the\nBlockchain system, they support sharding but not all of the systems\nsupport it. So, what we can do is just\nput that on top and support, that way some\ndata-parallel execution across Blockchains because if you look a bit deeper into\nthe execution models of Blockchains they are to\nbe fully serialized, a serialized execution with no parallel execution\nof transactions at all, and the sharding gives us\nsome way of parallelizing. We implemented a bunch\nof other optimizations. I want to go just in two of them and show you quickly\nwhat the performance and impacts are if you do that or if you implement\nthose in the Middleware. The first one is, so the question is if you\nprovide a put/get interface, what consistency can be provided\nif you use a Blockchain? In Blockchain key-value store, we support different notions\nof consistency levels or clients like\nconsistency levels that are more expensive\nor less expensive. The idea is that if\nyou give up some of the consistency similar to\nwhat normal databases also do, you can get higher\nperformance even when we use a Blockchain\nas a back-end. The idea here is that if you use a higher consistency\nlevel, for example, read your own writes, what we do in the Middleware\nif a write is coming in, if a put is coming in, it's first submitted to\nthe Blockchain but we don't wait for the transaction\nactually committed, but only that it's validated. After that, we just append it to a list in our Middleware, meaning that once a read is\ncoming in for the same key, at that moment we do lazy blocking on the\npending transaction and wait for\nthe transaction to be pre-committed before we\ngive back the value. So, this is one\ntechnique where you already don't need to wait for the full execution\nof a transaction, but you still get\na guaranteed consistency level which many of the\napplications desire. Or you can even go\nlower and provide only eventual consistency and even don't wait for\nthe transaction to be committed and execute, just read operations completely\non the status you are getting and monitor if these transactions\nare finally commit, so if you can still\nguarantee liveliness. What you see here is\nthat if you implement just on using a 50/50\nworkloads of 50 reads, 50 percent writes, and\nEthereum as a back-end. If you want to provide read\nyour own writes semantics, you get only throughput of 20 put/get operations\nat a second, and this is in line with\na block bench numbers. If you look a bit closer, they reported\nonly numbers as I said for max throughput and not\nfor average throughput. See, the eventual consistency gives you already a boost\nof a factor of five in terms of transactions\nwhich is not still there what many of\nthe application needs, but it's already a way of\ngetting higher performance out of your Blockchain system if you decrease\nthe consistency level. A second technique that\nactually is helping much more is that, in our Middleware we implemented\nsome form of batching. So, we don't submit puts one by one to the Blockchain\nbecause the pair of transaction overhead\nof validating transactions is pretty high. So meaning, if you\nbatch them together, so multiple puts\nin one Blockchain transaction, you can get, for example, if you block\nup to 500 puts in one call, the transaction rate of 1,200\ntransactions per second. After that, the\nmaximum message size we used here four byte\nintegers is exceeded, so that's the limit of\nbatching that you can use. So, the plain database\ntricks is one thing, but the question is now, I mentioned a third point\nwhich is important, that is getting verifiability\nof your operations. This is something that we also implemented inside Blockchain\nor inside our system. The idea of verifiable\nconsistency is that a client can verify the\ncorrectness of all operations, meaning if the puts\nand gets that he executed that he sees or that he executed adhere to the selected\nconsistency level. So, what does it mean for\neventual consistency? It means for the\neventual consistency that the client doesn't\nsee any fake reads. So, if you think about a\nscenario where, for example, the Blockchain\nMiddleware or one of the peers is malicious, he might return\njust the value that is not stored in your database and we want to be able to\ndetect it after the fact. If you use a Blockchain system\nout of the box, you don't get that guarantee. The second one is\nthat we want to, for example, our\neventual consistency, we will also want to\nsupport life in there. So, we want to assure that all the puts that\nI executed through BlockchainDB are actually stored in the Blockchain system and not dropped again by one\nof the components. So, the problem is\nthat as I mentioned, that all these operations or these guarantees could\nbe violated because, in our setup, we have\nmultiple untrusted components. One is our Blockchain\nkey value store that we introduced\nas a Middleware. But there's also\nthe peers themselves, if you look at them individually,\nthey are untrusted. Meaning, if you just go\nto one of the peers, we might get the problem\nof fake reads, and reads are actually\nexecuted by only one peer. So, it's a problem of detecting if you get a fake read or if, for example, the\nBlockchain Middleware or the peer drops a transaction\nand doesn't execute it. How we do it is so here\njust a high-level overview is the idea is that we use\ndeferred verification mechanism where every put that\nis executed through the key value store updates the write set in the\nBlockchain itself, and the clients additionally\nlock their actions, their reads and writes\nset, they don't need to do it for each individual call. But they lock the read\nand write set not using the Middleware layer, but bypassing the Middleware. They lock the reads and writes sets into the Blockchain as well. The nice point about these calls is they don't need to be synchronous blocking, you can just send\nthem asynchronously. At the end of your Epoch when you execute it multiple\nof the puts and gets, what you want to do is also\na verification procedure that looks into the question\nif the write set was included that\nthe clients reported via their record calls is included in the write set that the key\nvalue store was seen. This is also again a\nnon-blocking operation means we submit that as\na Blockchain transactions, so implemented as\na store procedure as a smart contract which checks if these two guarantees\nare satisfied. Once it's done, we can just fetch the result if the\nEpoch was correct, if all the operations\nhave been correct. In worst case, rollback in the transaction\nhistory to a point where the last verified Epoch\nwas stored in the database. So, we can also recover\nto valid checkpoints. Good. So there's much more, many more details that\nyou need to think about if you want to do verification with\nBlockchain and there are more details I haven't been\nincluding in the slides, but this is the general notion\nof how we want to ensure that puts and gets\nare executed correctly. So what are we up to next? So, as I said, it's a first step\nthat we implemented. There are many more optimizations that we haven't implemented. For example, caching\nin the Middleware but still guaranteeing\nverifiability. That's something we are\nworking on at the moment. Then for sure go in the route of having not just the put/get\ninterface but supporting full database transactions on top of our key value\nstore interface. So, in long-term, what we want to achieve\nor how we think that our Middleware could be integrated into a data\nmanagement stack is also have a combination of a database\nthat is running on-premise, where you use the\nBlockchain Database System to integrate something like a Shared column into\nyour local Database system. Meaning, you create a table, just mark your column\nas \"Shared\", and by getting the guarantees of verifiable transactions\nand sharing on those columns of data\nis automatically written to the Blockchain, and you can verify\nfor those columns if transactions on\nthose columns have been right. But this is something we haven't started thinking about in detail. With that, I'm at\nthe end of the talk, happy to take questions. I'm sure we have time for\nquestions at all. Yeah. >> So, you cited\na sigma paper saying that even if you set up a private environment\naround Blockchain, the throughput is\nvery limited, right? >> Yeah. >> So, intuitively\nI have hard time to understand why this case and I wonder if you can\nshare some insight. >> You mean why the transaction\nrate of Blockchains. So, I haven't been going into the details of the\nexecution models of Blockchains. But for example,\npublic Blockchain use a consensus protocol which\nis called \"Proof of Work\". Meaning, that one\nwas private, yeah. For them, as I said so, the complete transact\nfor private Blockchains, the problem is\nthat, the execution of all transactions\nis fully serialized. Meaning one node takes a set of transactions, executes them, distributes the results to all the peers in\nthe Blockchain and they re-execute\nthe transactions to verify the outcome\nof the transactions. Then, if different peers agrees or different peers or the majority agrees,\nthe block is appended. Which is inherently, so full replicated Database\nSystem that doesn't allow any concurrency and\nthe results that you are seeing is and there are many more overheads\nin Blockchains, which is not just\nthe execution but also verifying\nthe signatures for each and every transactions, etcetera. Yeah. Mike. >> I'm just curious if\nyou could give us a feel. I know you didn't go\ninto the details of Blockchain Protocols\nbut is there something fundamentally\ndifferent with using Blockchain as the backend for the key value store\nas opposed to if you were just\nbuilding a Federated Database over a bunch of slow Database Systems\nwhere you would be faced with a lot of\nthe same challenges? >> There are two answers from\nmy side to your question. The first one is,\nwhy don't you use a Database System or replicate the Database System from the start for\nthose use cases. But that's a valid question. So, the answer is, for me, people are using\nBlockchains nowadays and it has this legal notion that\ndata that is stored in a Blockchain can be used\nas evidence for court. So, there are already some mechanisms in place that\nyou don't have a database. There are reasons why people\nshould use a Blockchain. For some use cases, it's not possible to start with a Database System as\na starting point. The second one is,\nregarding the performance, I think that we saw already from the talk from\nMicrosoft in the morning, there's a lot going on in optimizing the performance of Blockchain Systems themselves. We just benefit from it. Whatever comes next\nas a platform, we can plug it in as a backend\nand use it and provide a verification guarantees on top. This is what, let's say\nthe value of what we provide is. So, you get the interface\nof a typical Database, you can verify your transaction. So put get operations as if\nit would be a Database but at the end, it's a Blockchain. So, we provide a stable interface you can program against it from your application and get the advantages from\nyour Blockchain Systems. >> Assume we moved from\n'Proof of Work\" to \"Proof of Stake\" and assume every block can pack tens of transactions. Where would you imagine would\nbe the next bottleneck, in terms of improving the performance of Blockchain\ntransaction processing? >> We haven't been ourselves\nnot looking too much into where the bottlenecks\nof current systems are. There two good papers that analyze actually the performance\nbottlenecks and where are the limits of how far could we push the performance if\nwe tweak the parameters. There's one from a bunch of\nauthors from ETH, Cornell, et cetera, where they theoretically\nanalyzed where is the upper bound with\nthe current protocols. I think that's a nice read. Anyway, the second\none is Blockbench, where we're running\nalready against different systems with\ndifferent consensus protocol workloads. From my perspective, what I think Blockchain should do is, the computational\nor the execution of transactions is\ninherently inefficient. As I said, it's completely\nsequentialized. There's no notion of concurrency, and I think Blockchains\ncan learn a lot from what databases have been\ndoing in concurrency. So, executing transactions as if they would be serialized. See, if they would be serial but having actually a concurrent\nexecution and if you can get some ideas of those into the next generation of\nBlockchain Systems, it would increase the performance and reduce the bottleneck of what current Blockchains have. >> All right. I think we are running\nslightly behind scheduled. If you have further questions, we might want to\ndo a short break. So, we'll thank the speaker. Yes. >> Thanks. >> So, the next speaker in\nthis session is Srinath. So, Srinath as a researcher\nat Microsoft Research at Redmond labs and\nSrinath is an expert on having periodic systems around verifying of computation, around computation verification. In this talk, he's going to talk about a system called Spice, which is about\nverifiable state machine and this work is going to\nappear at OSDA this year. >> Can you hear me?\nThink it's working. Okay, thanks. So this talk is about the powerful primitive card\nVerifiable state machines. The system that implements this primitive is called Spice. This primitive as\nmany applications in the context stuff for trustworthy Cloud Services as well as de-centralized\nBlockchains. I'll start by defining\nwhat this primitive is. A Verfiiable state machine is a primitive in which there are\nthree types of entities; a set of clients, a statefull service,\nand a set of verifiers. These clients issue\na st of request to the service and get back\na set of responses. Then the service\nperiodically publishes a trace which contains an entry for each request\nresponse pair. Then each of these verifiers\nrun instead set of local checks and then\noutput, accept or reject. Then we call such a primitive as a Verifiable state machine if it satisfies these properties. First, if the service behaves, that is the execution\nis equivalent to some serial execution of\nthe concurrent requests, then the verifier\nis output accept. Second, if the service\nmisbehaves with execution of a request or with concurrency\ncontrol mechanisms, then the probability that a verifier outputs accept\nshould be less than epsilon, where epsilon is very small. Third, the trace itself\nis zero knowledge, that is it does not\nreveal anything about the requests or the responses or the internal\nstate of the service beyond the validity of\nthe correct request execution. Finally, we require each entry\nin this trace to be small, for example, a few 100 bytes. It turns out, there's\na lot of prior work that implicitly implements this Verifiable State\nmachine abstraction. They do not use the state\nmachine formalism but it's not fundamental. The theory actually dates\nback to early 90's. But this theory was too\nexpensive to be implemented. How does a lot of\nwork that reduces the cost of this theory by\nall 20 orders of magnitude? These latter systems, supplied support for stateful computations in those earlier systems. For example, they support\nstorage interfaces such as key-value stores and\neven a limited form of SQL Databases. Despite this massive progress, all of these systems have\ntwo key limitations. First, the storage operations in these systems\nare very expensive. For example, it would\ntake tens of seconds or even several minutes for\neach storage operation. Second limitation is\nthat they only support a sequential model of execution for expressing\nthese services. As a result of\nthese two limitations, prior work can only support very limited throughput even\nfor very simple services. Our system, which is called Spice addresses\nthese limitations. First, it features a new\nstorage primitive that is two orders of magnitude more efficient than\nprior instantiations. Second, it supports\na concurrent model of execution for\nexpressing services. As a result of these two\nnew techniques, Spice can support thousands\nof transactions per second for many realistic\napplications. In the rest of\nthis talk, I'm going to focus on three things. First, I'll discuss\na few applications that can be built with\nverifiable state machines. Second, I'll present\nsome background on prior work and\na quick overview of Spice. Finally, I'll present\nsome experimental results. At a very high level, we are interested in this primitive verifiable state\nmachines for two reasons. First, it enables us to\nbuild cloud services in which we do not have to trust\nthe Cloud infrastructure. Second, it also enables private\nand efficient Blockchains both in the permission\nmembership model and permission-less\nmembership model. I'll start with the first\napplication scenario. The first application is\na Cloud-hosted ledger inspired by Sequence. Here, the service maintains balances of assets owned\nby different clients. It exposes three types\nof requests. First, the Issue operation\nenables an issuer which is a special entity in the system to issue some assets to a client. The second operation is\na Transfer that allows one client to transfer an asset\nto a different client. Finally, the last operation\nwhich is called Retire allows a client to take an asset out of the system. So in the status quo,\nif somebody wants to verify the correct execution\nof this service, they have to get a complete\ntrace of all the requests, responses, and the internal\nstate of the service. An auditor can verify the correct execution\nof the service without access to any of the\nrequests or the responses. It does not have to trust the infrastructure on which\nthe services is running. The second application\nis in the context of four decentralized\nBlockchain such as Ethereum. On Ethereum, a smart contract is essentially a state machine where two or more counter-parties can issue transactions to\ncreate state transitions. So in the status quo, all the transactions are actually stored on\nthe Blockchain. So this provides\nno confidentiality guarantees. Anyone in the world can\ninspect the internal state of the contract or also look at all the state transitions\na contract has gone through. Second, every request from the app must be processed\nby the Blockchain. So this limits the\napplication level throughput that you can get by storing a smart contract on\na public Blockchain. But as with verifiable\nstate machine, you don't actually\nhave to execute those smart contracts\non the Blockchain. You can execute them outside\nthe Blockchain and then process only a succinct zero-knowledge trace\non the Blockchain. Because this succinct trace\ndoes not reveal anything about the internal state of the requests or the responses, it provides very strong\nconfidentiality guarantees. Because Ethereum will only\nprocess a succinct trace, you can actually support\nvery high throughput for your applications which is independent of the throughput\nsupported by Ethereum. So I hope that I convinced you that verifiable state\nmachines are actually useful. So in the next part of this talk, I'm going to provide some\nbackground on a prior system called Pantry before I\nprovide an overview of Spice. So, Pantry itself extends\nto prior systems called Zaatar and Pinocchio to\nsupport a notion of state. All these three systems\nare composed of a front-end and a back-end. This front-end\ntranslates a C program into a set of\nalgebraic constraints. Then the back-end implements an argument protocol to prove the correct execution\nof the C program. I'm not going to go\ninto the details of how these components work, but I'll just observe that both Zaatar and Pinocchio support a large subset of C. This, in turn, enables verifying the execution of\nstateless programs. Then Pantry supports\nstate while working in the same stateless\ncomputation model by leveraging\ncryptographic hashes. I'm going to briefly tell\nyou how this is done. So the key idea in Pantry\nis to name data blocks using a short cryptographic\ndigest of those data blocks. Here's a very small\nC program that illustrates the key\nidea in Pantry. It takes as input\na digest and then the prover of the service\ncan actually supply state. Of course, because\nthe service is entrusted, it can support a supply\nany state to this program. But there is an assert\nstatement that checks if the digest supplied\nby the Verifier equals the cryptographic hash of the block supplied\nby the service. If the service supplies\nthe correct state, just check passes;\notherwise, this check fails. By using this idea, Pantry builds a key-value store. The core idea is to treat hashes of data as\npointers to such data. Then you can build\na tree and which in turn can be used to\nbuild a key value store. But the fundamental problem in this approach is that cost of a key-value store operation is logarithmic in\nthe size of the state. Completely, this means it takes several minutes of CPU time even with the million\nkey-value pairs in your state. Spice addresses\nthese performance problems. The core idea in Spice is we use a set data structure instead\nof a tree data structure. We then map key-value\nstore operations to operations on a set. As a result, the cost of\na storage operation is constant time instead of logarithmic on\nan amortized basis. However, if we instantiate\nthis idea naively, it's actually going to be more expensive than\nthe tree-based approach, constraints involved\nand in the case of many data sizes that\nwe are interested in. However, Spice\nsolves this problem. It does this by using\nan efficient instantiation of the set-based data structure using elliptic\ncurve cryptography. Spice also includes\nnew techniques to execute these state transitions or transactions inexpensively\nin this model. I'm not going to go\ninto the details of how all of this is done, but I'll just present\na few implementation details and how the system looks. We implement Spice\non top of Pantry. We also wrote three\napplications using Spice, but Spice includes\na toolchain using, but you can build\nmany more applications. The toolchain takes as input\na C program which expresses a request handler and then\nit outputs two executables, one for the service and\none for the verifier. This request handler can include arbitrary C or can also call\ninto Spice's storage APIs. The storage primitive\nitself exposes many APIs. First it provides you operations and key-value stores\nsuch as get and put. Second, it allows\nmutual exclusion of APIs such as lock and unlock, so you can lock a key, perform an update, and then unlock. It also provides a restricted\nform of transactions. So, you can call begin\ntransactions on a set of keys, it returns the current state\nof those keys. Then you can do arbitrary\ncomputation and then you can call end transactions with the values that you\nwant to write back. All of this update\nhappens atomically. In the next part of this talk, I'm going to present\nsome experimental results. There are two questions\nthat I'm interested in. First, how does Spice compare with prior\nstate-of-the-art? Second, what is the\nend-to-end performance of applications built with Spice? To answer these questions,\nwe run a set of experiments on Azure Cluster. So for the first question,\nwe measure the throughput of key-value store operations under Spice as well as a set\nof baseline systems. We preload the\nkey-value store with a million key-value\npairs and then we measure the throughput of the system for get\ninput operations separately. As against C, due to\nnew techniques in Spice, Spice can achieve\nup to four orders of magnitude speed up compared\nto the baseline systems. So to answer the second question, we implemented three\napplications and this graph depicts end-to-end\nperformance with varying number of CPU cores. In the x-axis, you\ncan see we have depicted various requests\ntypes such as issue, transfer and retire, that are supported by\nthese applications. As we can see, Spice achieves\na near linear speedup and throughput as we\nprovide more CPU cores. I did not depict\nthe verifier's throughput, but it's much more than the prover's throughput of\nthe services throughput which is 15 million proof verifications per second on the same cluster. So to summarize this talk, we believe verifiable state\nmachines is a key tool in the context of\nboth Cloud computing and decentralized Blockchains. Spice represents\na substantial progress towards efficiently implementing\nverifiable state machines. Finally, we are excited about the many possibilities\nthat this work points to. With that, I can take questions. Someone has a question. I'm sorry, I kind of lost the connection between\nspice and the Blockchain. So, where exactly, are you using spices'\ntechnology to implement Blockchains or is\nit a front end to Blockchains because you're\nusing a code generator? So, I don't know exactly\nwhere the connection is. >> There are two applications\nthat I guess I can go back. Here is scenario that I presented in the context of Blockchain. So history of running the entire smart contract\non the Blockchain, and that executing the contract on every node in\nthe Blockchain system, you could run it once and\nthen you could just process that succinct zero knowledge\ntrace on the Blockchain. So, the entire Blockchain\nnetwork would just verify that there was\na valid state transition, and it does not\nhave to re-execute any transactions and\nthey also don't need to know what the contract was or what this\ncontract was doing. So it provides confidentiality\nand also scalability. >> So, you are basing like\na front end to the Blockchain? >> Yes. >> So, you don't need to use a Blockchain in the back and\nyou could put in a database. >> Sure. Yeah. >> If I did it, the Blockchain\nis actually not relevant. >> Yes. So, here, only the verifier is\nrunning the Blockchain but you could run\nthat verifier anywhere. >> Right. >> Even the service itself\ncould be running outside the Blockchain using\ntraditional databases. >> All right. Okay. Thank you. >> The trace includes all the\nhashes of the state. Yes. >> Can you return to the slide that gave the big picture of requests going into\nthe Blockchain and the trace going to the verifies? >> Is it this slide? >> Yes. Could you say what information the verifiers have access to in order\nto make the decision? This picture depicts only\nan append-only trace. Are they aware of\nother information? >> Yes, they do know the\nspecification of the service. For example, what means for\ntaking a state transition, so they know the code that represents the state transition. They also know some encoding of the requests and\nthe encoding of the responses. So, this trace has an entry for each request response pair. >> So the verifiers are aware of something\nabout the requests. >> They don't know the actual plaintext contents\nof the request, but they have\na succinct encoding which is a commitment to\nthose requests. >> Thanks. >> Quick question while\nwe're on this slide. So, you defined soundness\nin terms of some epsilon. So what should I think\nof epsilon as being like the Internet is very large, and there are many requests? >> Yes. >> So, how often in\npractice would you expect soundness to be violated?? >> Yeah. So, this epsilon\nis one and two power 128, so you can think of it\nas 128 bit security. So, it should be very small\nlike you should absolutely not see verified accepting some incorrect\nstatement as correct, except with that one\nand two power 128, which is the security of\nmany crypto primitives that we use. Thank you. >> So, the final presentation in the session is by Professor, Dawn Song from UC Berkeley. So, she has a whole\nbunch of works. So she is a MacArthur fellow, she's associates at\nGuggenheim fellow and MIT TR-35 award, and she has like\nseveral best papers in security and learning\nconferences, and she also happens to\nbe the co-founder of a startup in Blockchain\ncalled Oasis labs, and I believe that some of the work she'll be\ntalking about is based on, is related to the startup also. >> Okay. Great. Hello. Hi everyone. So,\nthe mic is working. Okay. Great. Thanks\na lot for being here, I am Dawn Song, I am a professor in\ncomputer science at UC Berkeley, and also I'm a founder\nand CEO of Oasis Labs. Today, I'll talk about privacy preserving\nsmart contracts as scale and new Blockchain\nplatform, that we're building. Okay. So, right. I know data is the new oil, and all this data can really help us with the value of data\nanalytics and machine learning, and help us get insights in many different domains\nincluding healthcare, financial services and IoT. A lot of data is also\nsensitive and and we actually and facing allows us big problems in\nthe data domain today. For example, data breaches at the common place now,\nfor example Equifax, one of the largest\ncredit card companies had the recent data\nbreaches where attackers were able to steal sensitive information about\nmore than 140 million users. On the other hand, a lot\nof valuable data is also being siloed because\nit is sensitive. They could really be utilized, and hence a lot of data\nwere not able to extract valuable insights from\nall this data including for example medical data and\nfinancial data and so on. Also, at the same time, users are losing control\nof their data as demonstrated in the recent\nCambridge Analytica incident. So, on the other hand, we are seeing that\nBlockchain is providing a transformative technology and aiming to solve\na number of problems. Blockchains aims to provide\nopenness and transparency, and allow us to not to\nrely on anything to party, and provides automatic\nenforcement of agreements. So, so far, what has\nBlockchains brought us? It helps with payments, with ICOs and cryptokitties. So, the question is in the future we hope that Blockchain can do\neven greater things, can help us to revolutionize\nmany different segments in industry including\nfinancial services, healthcare, IoT and\nmany other domains. So, today I wanted to talk about some new technology that we\nhave been developing that actually helps bringing\nthe Blockchain technology to a broader domain to enable these other more\nadvanced applications than the ones that\nwe have seen today, and also at the same time\nhelp solve some of these data security\nand privacy problems that I just mentioned\nat the beginning. So, first, let me give\nyou one motivating example how in such example, how Blockchain help\nsolve the problem and also where we need the new\ntechnologies in Blockchain. So, this motivating example is in the area of fraud detection. So for example, for banks, they need to do\nfraud detection to figure out whether they\nshould give someone along or with that suspicious\nand malicious activities. So, typically, high\nworks is that each bank using its information can\nchange its own fraud detector, and because the data is sensitive and usually\nit is difficult to find different banks to\ncollaborate together. However, as we all know, the effectiveness of\nthese tab of models, and it really depends on the amount of data that\nthe model is trained on or the broad views that\nthe model actually had seen. Hence, it would have been\nreally nice if we can develop a technology that allows these different banks\nto collaborate together, and using the data from\neach of the banks together to develop a better machinery\nmodel for fraud detector. Unfortunately, today, we don't have a technology to enable the banks to do this because\nof privacy concerns, regulatory risks, and\nthe misaligned incentives. >> So, this is an example where actually Blockchain can\nhelp and in particular, a new type of\na Blockchain technology such as the ones that\nwe're developing can help. We can actually develop\nsmart contract, in this case, a fraud\ndetector smart contract, that runs on top\nof the Blockchain. In this case,\nthe different banks, and each of them can\nactually contribute data to this smart contracts, and that together using the data from\nthese different sources, the fraud detector\nsmart contract can change fraud detection model. Hopefully, this\nfraud detection model that change using data from\ndifferent banks can be much more effective\nand can really help each bank to deal with\nthe fraud much better. However, in order to enable\nan application like this, we need to solve a number\nof challenges and issues. So, first, in\na typical Blockchain, actually, our data in compute on the\nBlockchain is public. In this case, we are dealing with very sensitive data, essentially\ncustomers' transactions. So, we need to handle\nthe challenge of having sensitive data on\nthe Blockchain worker notes, essentially protecting\nthe computation process of this much contract execution from leaking\nsensitive information. Secondly, the computer\nfraud detection model itself can potentially leak\nsensitive information about the inputs because the\nmachine in the model here that is changed from\nsensitive inputs to start with, and I'll show a little bit later that our work has shown that even when you\nturn machinery model, I feel I'm now careful with\nthe privacy protection than this two-dimensional boundary\nitself can actually leak sensitive information\nabout the inputs. Finally, to this Blockchain has a huge scalability issues and to this Blockchain has poor\nperformance and very high costs. So again, in order to enable\nan application like this, we really need to be able to\nscale up the Blockchain and scalability to enable a real-world\napplications like this, and ideally at\nthe class scale event. >> Question. What about the smart contract that\nthe fraud detection model? Isn't that private? Isn't that important too? >> So, that's why I\nwill talk about this. Yes. So, we're actually\ngoing to develop a privacy preserving\nsmart contracts that can help save others. So, in order to enable\napplication like this and address the challenges\nthat I just mentioned, an Oasis where developing a new Blockchain technology\ncalled privacy, one of the key about\nBlockchain platform is Privacy-preserving\nSmart Contracts at Scale. So first, one of the key primitive of our platform is a Privacy-preserving\nSmart Contracts. The premise of Privacy-preserving\nSmart Contracts satisfies a number of unique\nproperties and capabilities. It enables automatic enforcement of codified privacy requirements. So, the privacy requirements here as coded into\nthe smart contracts. We can enforce this\nwithout relying on any central party\nand it's designed to scale to real-world applications including heavy workloads\nsuch as machine learning. We design the technology to make it easy to use and\nto make it much easier for Developers to build the privacy-preserving\napplications without needing to be a privacy experts. In order to enable this Privacy-preserving\nSmart Contract at Scale, we developed a number of different technologies\nand combined together to build\nour Oasis Blockchain platform. The Oasis Blockchain platform\nessentially has, you can do to it's\ntwo main parts, there's the platform\ncomponent and there is the application components\nwhere the smart contracts is the abstraction at\nthe application level. So, at the platform\nlevel, so first, we build confidentiality-preserving\nsmart contract execution to protect the smart contract\nexecution process from leaking sensitive\ninformation about the inputs. At the application level\nwithin the smart contract, we provide capabilities for\nprivacy-preserving analytics and machine learning to make it easy for Developers\nto do analytics and machine learning without\nneeding to worry about privacy, and to enforce the desire\nto privacy policies. At the platform level, we also developed\na new architecture for the Blockchain to enable scalable smart contract\nexecution in particular for scalability for complex\nsmart contract execution. So, now, let me talk about each component\ntechnology separately. So, first, let me talk about the confidentiality-preserving\nsmart contract execution. So typically, again,\nas I mentioned, so most Blockchain today, they data and compute our\npublic on the Blockchain, hence they can only have\nvery limited used cases. So, in this case, the inputs to the smart\ncontracts is public, and the smart contracts essentially then\ntakes the inputs, and does a computation, and performs a state transition. Also, the states of\nthe smart contracts, in most of today's Blockchain\nplatform is also public. So, well, confidentiality-preserving\nsmart contracts execution essentially here,\neverything's encrypted. So, the data is encrypted and also the state is\nencrypted as well. The smart contract\nessentially and that's a computation\non encrypted data, and to perform\nthe state transition. Also, at the same time, we want to ensure that even though the data in\nstates are encrypted, we still want to ensure\nthat we can have a proof of correctness that this state\ntransition is correct. >> So, the question is\nhow we actually enable this practical way of doing computation over encrypted\ndata and in particular, this confidentiality\npreserving execution. So, this essentially, we\ndo this by leveraging a combination of different techniques\nfor secure computation. For insecure computation,\nessentially, we have two main types\nof approaches. The first one is\nsecure hardware and the advantage of secure hardware is that it's\na highly performance. Its performance is close\nto native computation, and it can support for\ngeneral purpose computation. The challenge for\nthe other types of approach is crypto based techniques such as secure multi-party\ncomputation and fully homomorphic\nencryption, so on. The challenge for\nthis type of approach is that the preference overheads\ncan be very high. Oftentimes, its orders of magnitude higher than\nnative computation, and hence, it can only be used for very limited use cases. In the Oasis Blockchain platform, we actually use a combination of these different techniques\nand depending on the actual use cases\nof the smart contracts, we use a different\ncombinations of these techniques to enable confidentiality\npresuming execution. So now, let me just briefly say a few words about the secure\nhardware aspects. So, the secure hardware here, one obstruction is called just the execution\nenvironments and also here we call it\nthe Secure Enclave. The idea of Secure\nEnclave is that, here we can run a program, in this case, a smart contracts inside the Secure Enclave, and then in this case, the operating system and the application that\nruns outside of the Secure Enclave will now be able to tamper with\nwhat's around the inside, and also will not be able to see what's running\ninside, and hence, the Secure Enclave\nhelps to provide integrity and confidentiality\nof the execution. Also, at the same time, the hardware provides\na hardware-based mechanism for remote attestation\nsuch that the remote to verify can remotely\nverify what has been run inside\nthe Secure Enclave and its initial states. So, we have developed a research\nproject called Ekiden, leveraging approaches\nlike this and so we provide security proof\nusing universal composability, and that we have\ndeveloped a number of sample applications, including tiny\nmachinery models in healthcare domain and\nsmart building domain, and many other applications. So here, one of the key capabilities that were used to enable confidentiality presuming smart\ncontract execution as leveraging the capability\nof Secure Enclaves, and in fact, the Secure Enclaves can serve as a\ncornerstone security primitive even beyond the application domain\nof Blockchains. Secure Enclaves can provide strong security capabilities\nand can serve as a platform for building\nnew security applications that couldn't be\nbuilt otherwise for the same practical performance. Over the years, so all the hardware\nmanufacturers have recognized the importance of building secure hardware and they all have built different solutions, but however, we still have huge challenges in\nbuilding secure hardware. For example, how secure can it be under what threat models? What would you entrust\nwith the secure hardware? The ultimate challenge is, can we actually create a truly trustworthy\nSecure Enclave as a cornerstone security\nprimitive that can be widely deployed and enable secure systems to\nbe built on top. If we can do this,\nthen we can truly usher the whole community into a new secure computation era. So, what's a path towards getting trustworthy\nSecure Enclave. So, first we need to have\na open source design. Open source design provides transparency that's needed\nfor the whole community together to analyze and verify the security and correctness\nof the Secure Enclave, and that can enable\nmuch higher assurance. Also, open-source design\nhelps build a community. Also ideally, we would like to provide a formal verification of the Secure Enclave\nand we want to ensure a secure supply\nchain management for securing the\nmanufacturing process. So, towards this goal, we are doing a project\ncalled the Keystone Enclave, aiming to build\nopen-source Secure Enclave on top of RISC-V, TEE, which is an open-source\nrisk architecture that's available today, and that we provide\nstrong memory isolation, and many other properties. I would have called to enable open-source Secure Enclave\nthat can really be deployed and be used and\nthe manufacturers by any manufacturer and be\nused in the real world. RISC-V actually has been\nwidely adopted in industry. The RISC-V Foundation has more\nthan a 100 members and you can find out more\ninformation about Keystone at our website\nkeystone-enclave.org, and we have a number of goals encased in the\nprojects to help us to finally achieve the goal of building an open-source\nSecure Enclave. This is a collaboration\nbetween Berkeley and MIT and with the other\ninstitutions joining, and we plan to have\na first release this fall on both with deployed on FPGA, as well as, actually on the demo chip HiFive\nUnleashed the RISC-V chip. So, that's the first\ncomponent technology, confidentiality-preservings\nsmart contract execution, and then also, quickly talk about the second component\ntechnology for privacy-preserving analytics\nand machine learning. So, while we do data analytics\nand machine learning, there's a lot of privacy risks. So, for example here, there are two types of questions, one is how many trips\nwere taken in New York City last year? And the other one's,\nhow many trips did Joe take last week? So, as you can see you, one question reflects a trend and the other one actually leaks sensitive information\nabout the individual. But, to answer\nboth type of queries, you actually both need to actually have access\nto data, and hence, this is an example\nshowing that just having access control is\ninsufficient to be able to protect privacy and at the same time being able to\nanswer queries like this. There has also been\nproposals using Data Anonymization technologies\nto solve this problem, but that's also insufficient Data Anonymization can reduce the utility of data and\nalso at the same time, it provides insufficient\nprivacy protection. There's a research showing that anonymized dataset actually, one is combined with the other publicly available\ndatasets can be used to re-identify\nusers and hence, leaking sensitive information\nabout individuals. We've also done\nthe recent work showing that when you want to train\na deep learning model, you actually really need\nto be very, very careful. So, the question here is, do neural networks actually\nremember training data? If yes, can attackers\nactually extract secrets in the training data\nfrom just simply querying the learned models. So, in collaboration\nwith researchers from Google in our recent paper, here is an example of one of\nthe key studies which show that while we train a language model on\nthe email dataset, in this case, it's\na public Enron dataset. The Enron email dataset\nnaturally contains credit card numbers and\nsocial security numbers of actual users and we demonstrated that\nattackers can actually craft attacks to them by just quering the language model\nto be able to extract the credit card numbers and\nsocial security numbers from the original\ntraining datasets. This is an example demonstrating that even when you are training\na machine learning model, you have to be really\ncareful to take the correct measure to\nprotect users' privacy. So luckily, here we actually\nhave a good solution, and so we are training\na neural deep learning model, instead if we change a differentially privates\ndeep learning model that, in this case, both from our\nproposed measure, as well as, an attack evaluation,\nwe demonstrate that by tuning a differentially private\ndeep learning model, we can provide much stronger privacy protection for the users. >> So, I'm running out of time. So, I won't have time\nto actually go into the details about\ndifferential privacy. So, differential privacy\nat a high level is essentially a formal\nprivacy notion that helps to measure for algorithm and the editor\nanalytics algorithm, or machine learning\nalgorithm whether it can distinguish whether\na particular user's data has been used in producing the data analytics results or tuning the machine\nlearning model. So, differential privacy provides a very strong notion for protecting user's privacy in data analytics and\nmachine learning. There has been\nvery limited real-world use of differential privacy including Google and Apple use differential privacy\nin very limited setting. There's no previous\nreal-world's deployments of differential privacy for\ngeneral-purpose analytics. There are a number\nof challenges for deploying differential privacy in practice in the real world including usability\nfor non-experts, broad support for\nanalytics queries in machine learning and also easy integration with\nexisting data environments. There's no previous system that addresses all these issues. In collaboration\nwith Uber we have developed new systems to address these challenges and in\nour system Chorus and Optio, we essentially develop\ntechniques and tools to automatically\nrewrite data analytics and machine learning\npipelines to enforce differential privacy as well as other desired privacy\nrequirements. Some of our technology has\nalready been deployed at Uber for protecting privacy in their internal data analytics. So, putting together\nconfidentiality preserving smart contract\nexecution and privacy preserving data analytics\nand machine learning. So, this enables the privacy\npreserving smart contracts. Now, let me just\nbriefly talk about the third component technology as scalable smart\ncontract execution. Again, I don't have\na lot of time left so let me just go over\nthis very quickly. So, typically when people talk about Blockchain\nscalability, one thing that people\nimmediately think about is Blockchain sharding. It's like you have one lane\nof cars but now you have many lanes in parallel to improve the throughput\nof the traffic. However, this type of approach is good for high-throughput of simple transactions but however, for the Blockchain applications\nthat we want to build these are much more complex and so the difference smart contracts can also\ndepend on each other. So, to enable scalability\nin particular scalability for complex smart\ncontract execution, we have designed and developed a different Blockchain\narchitecture than previous Blockchain\narchitectures. In particular by separating\nout execution from consensus. By decoupling the\ndifferent functions that a Blockchain is providing. So, our design is inspired by a few key observations\nof the limitations and challenges in today's\nBlockchain approaches. So first, a Blockchain\nplatform essentially provides three main\nfunctionalities consensus, storage and compute. Our functions in most of today's Blockchain platforms or the three functionalities\nare coupled together and hence makes it really difficult to\nscale and also hear consensus as\nthe slow operation and is often the key bottleneck. When we do sharding, coordination also is expensive and can limit\nthe scalability as well. So, based on these observations and to address these challenges we propose a new\nBlockchain architecture for what we call separating\nexecution from consensus. Where we actually decouple these different functionalities\nof a Blockchain platform, where we separate out\nthe consensus layer, the storage layer and\nthe compute layer. Where the computer executes the smart contracts and the storage layer\npersist the state and the consensus layer agrees\non the state transitions. So, I think here there's\nlimited time so I probably won't have time to\ngo into the details here. So, essentially to separate execution from a consensus we- so again the compute layer does the computation and in this case actually the compute\nnodes are stateless so no consensus protocols\nare necessary and they can optimistically\nexecute the transactions. In this case the failures\nhave no effect on the state, and the states are persistence to the storage layer\nwhere the blocks are persisted and replicated and again no consensus protocol are necessary and writes in\nthis case are idempotent. Finally, the state transitions are committed to the consensus\nlayer and here we use verifiable computation to\nverify the correctness of the computation and\nthe consensus layer essentially tracks\nthe state transitions and the transaction ordering. Then we use different types\nof techniques for verifiable computing\nincluding majority votes, and a new approach that we\ndeveloped and discrepancy detection and we can also use other methods such as zero-knowledge proofs for\nverifiable computing. So, putting all these\ntechnologies together, we enable privacy preserving\nsmart contracts as scale. Here is one of the applications that we have been building, together with\nother collaborators from ETH and doctors from Stanford\nas well as app developers. >> An application called Kara, a privacy-preserving\ntokenized data markets for medical data. So, medical data is locked in\ndata silos and the goal of Kara is to incentivize\ndoctors and patients to share data and improve\nmedical research. We want to provide an easy, fast, and secure way for\ndoctors and patients to essentially upload\ntheir data to the platform and share their data and they\ncan earn rewards for it, while at the same time,\npreserving their privacy. By utilizing the\nprivacy-preserving smart contracts on top of the Oasis Blockchain, the medical researchers can write their privacy-preserving\nsmart contracts and within the smart contracts, it can contain code for training machine\nlearning models, as well as, serving machine learning\nmodels and also the smart contracts can specify terms of\nuse, for example, how users may get compensated for\ncontributing their data to the smart contract. Also, users and patients, they can also specify their own privacy requirements\nfor their data and if they agree to\nthe terms of use of the smart contract developed\nby the medical researchers, then they can contribute\ntheir data to the smart contracts developed\nby the medical researcher. Once the smart contract\ncollects enough data, then it can train machine\nlearning models over the data and then this way can\nhelp medical researchers and pharmaceutical\ncompanies to do their medical research and to help find better cures\nfor diseases. With this approach,\nit can significantly reduce the friction for\nmedical researchers and pharmaceutical companies to\nget access to data to be able to train machine learning\nmodels for their work. This is just one of many examples for\nthe different use cases that a Blockchain platform\nlike this can enable by providing both\nprivacy protection, as well as, scalability. We just launched\nOasis Labs recently, we raised $45 million and\nwe have a lot to build, we actually also have\nlaunched our private Testnet, and we're inviting\ndevelopers to join our premier Testnet to build applications and new technologies\non top of our platform. So, at Oasis Labs, we're\nbuilding privacy-first, high performance Cloud computing\nplatform on Blockchain. New computing paradigm and\ncomputing platform that has a unique combination\nof set-up properties, privacy protection,\nscalability, as well as, without needing to rely\non any central party. We hope that this\ntechnology can really help enable completely\nnew type of applications to be built that\ncouldn't be built today and for more information\nyou can go to the website. Thank you. Questions? >> Hi, I'm going back to\nyour original example. The original example\nis there were two banks and you wanted to build a machine learning model that combined\nthe datasets. Right? >> Multiple banks. >> Yeah, multiple banks.\nSo, my question is can it come to solve this problem by\njust using secure hardware? What is the Blockchain\nconnection? It seems like you're\nunioning datasets, so just encrypt the data, register keys, and\nsecure hardware and maybe run a R program\ninside hardware. >> Right. >> So, what is\nthe Blockchain connection? Are you afraid of someone\ntampering the data? Why do you need Blockchains? >> So, usually when\nyou use Blockchain as that you don't want to rely\non your central party. So, then you don't need to say like who is operating\nthat, so, essentially, you have a Blockchain platform that people don't even\nneed to agree on. Like who should be trusted and who should\nbe operating this? So, it's just right\na platform that without relying on any central party and in particular in this case, like here I just gave\nan example of a few banks, but you can imagine that in\nother scenarios you can have many parties and you\nare now going to have all of them to agree, to reach agreements on\nlike who they want to trust and who should be coordinating and running\nall these things. So, with the Blockchain,\nit just helps to again removing the reliance\non any such party. >> Another question, but the smart contract code itself that the\nregister number object. That'll still be public that\nis not encrypted, right? >> That's a very\ngood question, so in our platform\nactually this will be a choice of the developers. So, the developer can specify either they want\ntheir smart contract to be public or they can\nbe fully private. Yeah, in which case,\nit will be encrypted. >> So, there's also this company\nEnigma from MIT and I was reading their white\npaper and it seems like they were also trying to solve\nsomething very similar, so maybe if you could say something comparing\nthe two approaches that would be really helpful. >> I think for privacy-preserving\nsmart contracts, in general, people\nunderstand its importance. Actually, I think it's\na very good problem for many people to solve and\nI think it'll be great to see the whole community\ncome together to overcome\nthis problem and solve this problem as\nour academic paper is the first paper in a community\nthat came out that actually develop\ntechnology on this, and again I think it's\na very important problem, we want to encourage\nthe whole community to actually work on this. >> I had one follow-up question. So, in one of your earlier slides you had approaches, right? You were using secure hardware, using multiparty\ncomputation, you are using zero-knowledge proofs\nand potentially others. So, my question is like let's assume that secured hardware\nis really secured. There I know there\nare issues with that like what do you\nneed other approaches because won't it be\nable to solve like say multi-party competition if\nyou have a secured hardware? >> Okay, yes that's\na very good question. So, essentially one\nof the main goals of the Oasis platform with this\nprivacy-preserving smart contracts primitive\nis that we want to offer to make it easier for application developers to use state of the art security and privacy technologies without\nneeding to be a experts, and also in this case\nessentially we provide a unified secure\ncomputing framework to leverage a combination of these different technologies, and yes, if you're really choose to fully trust\nthe secured hardware, then essentially you\ndon't need to use the other and like the crypto\nbased techniques, but however, depending on the actual use case and also depending on\ndevelopers preference. So, some developers they just want to use\ncrypto based techniques and if their application logic\nis simple enough and they don't care too much about\nthe performance overheads, then we are happy to offer them the choice of not\nrelying on secure hardware. >> Any other questions?\nOkay, so let's thank the speaker again.\nThanks, everybody."}, {"id": "dfC-E2ntGTE", "link":

"transcript": " in this video I'm gonna share some of the top crypto projects that you should watch out for in 2020 I just released a video talking about decentralized finance or defy and how I think it's going to be one of the big trends in blockchain for 2020 so this is a follow up video where I'm gonna highlight some of those projects in detail and show you how they fit together and how they could drive continued adoption of blockchain technology throughout this year so before we get into that if you're new around here hey I'm Gregory from adapt University on this channel I teach you how to become a blockchain developer so if that's something that you're interested in click the like button down below could subscribe and if you want real-time help becoming a blockchain developer my brand new program blockchain and mastery University comes out in January 29th you can click the link down below to sign up so let me share these top projects for 2020 and like I said these are all d5 projects so why do I think dphi is such a huge trend well mostly because it serves the needs of people who are already using the blockchain cryptocurrency traders and it provides benefits you can't get somewhere else like earning competitive interest rates on your money and that's key to growing the ecosystem because that's what I think it takes to onboard new users providing real tangible benefits that you can't get somewhere else so what I want to do now is highlight some of these top projects and show how they fit together to provide these kinds of benefits that are ultimately going to grow defy and just adoption of blockchain technology in general the first project that I want to talk about is maker Dell all right you might have already heard of maker before but it's really important for me to mention it for a few reasons they provide one of the most fundamental use cases in decentralized finance which is a stable currency so one of the big problems of the cryptocurrency in general is that the price is always changing it makes it really bad as a medium of exchange if they'll be really bad to use it to like just buy your groceries or coffee or you know a car or something like that okay so maker gives you a stable currency whose price doesn't change and that's a huge benefit of defy that's gonna act as a building block upon which you can achieve all these other benefits all right so the next big benefit would be actually earning interest on that stable currency an interest that's better than you could earn inside your own bank account and that's where the next project comes into play this is compound finance compound does just that alright it allows you to put your money inside this app and earn a better interest rate than you potentially could somewhere else you can start doing this with all kinds of cryptocurrencies you can see all of them listed here but you'll see that it supports Die which I just mentioned a minute ago and see here on die you can see that you can earn a 5.8 percent APR it's still a lot better than most people gonna earn inside their own bank accounts and that's a huge benefit of decentralized finance so in order to use compound you go to an app like this connect your wallet take your currency and lock it in here it's awesome that they have this amazing looking app that allows you to do this but there's a huge benefit of compound that's outside just this user interface that you see here and that's the actual underlying protocol itself alright other apps can actually hook into this to take advantage of all these benefits like earning a high interest rate so if you were a normal user who hadn't ever used the blockchain before what if there was a more seamless way to use something like the compound protocol where you didn't even have to know about the compound finance website well that's exactly what I'm gonna talk about right now alright the next project is argent and this is a new crypto wallet it can lock into the compound protocol without having to use the compound finance website so imagine you're a new user you can get some die instantly put it in a wallet like argent and start earning that 5% plus interest rate and that's a huge benefit right you could move your money out of a bank account put in this wallet and start earning better interests I highly recommend checking out argent this is a project you want to keep your eye on for sure so now with all these pieces you've got a way to get stable currency put it in a wallet see it on your phone and start earning interest that's better than your bank account with these three different pieces that's what's really cool about this is you can combine all these things together a lot of people talk about d5 being money Legos or you can just take all these protocols and hook them together to get these kinds of benefits so let's talk about another benefit what if you could also add support for things besides fiat currencies on the blockchain right what if you could do or fiat currencies as a stable currency like you know euros or yen what if you could do stocks what if you could do gold well that's exactly where the next project comes into play all right this is synthetics so this is decentralized synthetic assets that get modeled on the blockchain we're talking about gold stocks and Forex he uses this concept of cents which are blockchain representations of these other commodities and assets all right so they're powered by smart contracts in the blockchain there you are decentralized and you can you know get on synthetics exchange and start trading them and there's all kinds of benefits to this right like what if you could just trade these assets on the blockchain apart from the traditional financial system right you could trade around the clock you wouldn't have to wait for exchanges to open and close you wouldn't have to kyc in order to trade in many cases there's lots of benefits that I can think of and that's one reason that synthetics is such a huge project free to keep your eye on there's two ways that I think Defy can be improved to accelerate adoption over the long term all right and even in 2020 these two areas are privacy and access to off chain data so there's two projects that I want to talk about in particular to keep your eye on for 2020 that are working on these things all right so the first is privacy and the product that I want to talk about here is tornado cache so what's the deal with privacy and what are they doing to work on this all right so by nature all the transactions on the etherium blockchain are public they're traceable you can always see like who sent any kind of asset from one account to another any time a transaction was made okay so it solves this problem by using something called a mixer where essentially you send a cryptocurrency to a smart contract and a bunch of other people also saying cryptocurrency to this smart contract and then you withdraw your cryptocurrency on the other side so that the sender was the smart contract and you can't necessarily trace it back to your original deposit all right it mixes everybody's funds together so that you don't know who the original sender was if you're the recipient so that's what Toronado cash does you can see the app here you can use it natively on this website but what I would love to see our protocols like this plugging into the other protocols and I talked about earlier you know you know building things with these money Legos to implement privacy maybe you could add this as a layer between you and your wallet to implement some form of privacy for your crypto wallet okay so the second way in which I think D Phi can be greatly improved is by incorporating off chain data or real world data into your blockchain apps so what is off chain data well it's any data or information that doesn't actually originate on the blockchain so for example the price of Bitcoin right what if you wanted to pull the price of Bitcoin and use it inside of a smart contract well your smart contract code lives on the blockchain and the price of Bitcoin is you know pulled in from price aggregators across multiple exchanges alright so how do you make these two things work well you use something called an Oracle and that's exactly what chain link is this is the project I want to talk about okay so chain link is a decentralized Oracle service and basically it's a network that provides reliable tamper proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts on any blockchain so what if you had some sort of decentralized finance application that you know relied upon the price of certain cryptocurrency is in order to behave in a decentralized way with the smart contracts so like for example if you had some sort of protocol that depended upon the Bitcoin price or depended on the price of ether and wanted to know that information whenever you're making transactions well that's the problem that chain link is solving they basically try to provide a network of Oracle's that make this data trustworthy have actual integrity because the alternative is just trusting somebody you know maybe a single entity to provide this information to the app you lose this benefit of decentralization that way so that's a list of d-5 projects to keep your eye on for 2020 and there's lots of debates on you know what we should actually be using this space for who's going to use it and where it's headed I'm really excited I want to pull in a few conversations that I've seen on Twitter recently first one is that you know aetherium has a monopoly on D Phi and there doesn't seem to be much disagreement on this like if you go to a website like d5 pulse calm which I showed you earlier and you look at all the projects you see their projects I talked about maker synthetics compound pretty much everything's built on a theorem alright so not too much disagreement there but some people like wonder what we should be doing with this I talked about synthetics giving you access to off chain assets and modeling them the block chain well I saw this debate recently about key project and their desire to launch T BTC as a trustless mechanism for tokenizing Bitcoin on the etherium chain right so this would be a way to basically own Bitcoin on the etherium blockchain and the prediction that d-file would explode to Heights far beyond anything we can currently imagine so you know you see this adoption curve over the past year so right imagine if this curve just went parabolic and went up like crazy so what would that do to the price of ether the underlying currency that's powering all these projects and be really interesting to see again not financial advice just something to think about but there's a skepticism right people talk about there's no such thing as a trustless bridge and that's what will be required in order to tokenize Bitcoin on the etherium chain right you basically would have to lock assets on one side and transfer them to another there's been lots of projects who have implemented bridges with varying degrees of success but this is a good thing to talk about so there's lots of debates on what we should be doing with defy what we should be doing with defy I think at the end of the day it comes down to what's the demand for and you know what trade-offs are people actually willing to make right are there maybe some centralized parts of this that we're okay with being centralized are there other parts that are just you know non-negotiable I would definitely don't want to mislead people or have a big security vulnerability where people lose all their money cuz that would be really bad for the space in the long run tell me what you all think down in the comments section below what should we be doing with these five what should we not be doing with defy where do you see this space headed in 2020 I'm really excited about it I think we need to keep our eye on this especially if we're trying to spread blockchain as a use case for normal people so if y'all like this video again subscribe to the channel if you haven't already click the

crypto-currency enthusiasts maybe if you don't mind it we'll just go back a little bit you were employee one at Quinn base yes back when what year was that 2013 okay and and I guess you've got interests encrypted before that yeah so I was in college when I got into Bitcoin and I wrote my undergraduate thesis on Bitcoin in 2011 and what and what first got you excited about it so when I first read about it I thought there's no way this is possible to have a native Internet money that isn't controlled by any sort of central party so I found it fascinating it's very sort of technically yeah but then once I dug into it I kind of thought about this and order implications and you realize this is a huge deal it means that for the first time you can have digital scarcity on the internet and of course you could move to a global unified financial and monetary system that's outside the scope of any sort of sovereign state political control and is really opt-in by all the users so the general idea was just really fascinating to me and I really did right away sort of like buy as much Bitcoin is that but that was back when the you know when Bitcoin was going to the dominant idea and everyone thought the kind of main thing you could do with this kind of new architecture was digital money since then the the kind of possibility space at least to me feels like it's expanded dramatically yes it has and and so to me the big moment was when a theory launched for me I started seeing a big like breakthrough in my head was when I realized that if you're even wallets were actually more like browsers then then bank accounts and I started seeing some stuff get built on ethereum that people in Bitcoin had tried to do for a long time in Bitcoin you only have one asset which is bitcoins people had tried to build other sorts of tokens or assets that would settle to the Bitcoin blockchain and there were projects like master coin counterparty we funded this project lighthouse Rio oh yeah oh yeah and that was basically decentralize crowdfunding yeah it was crowdfunding on Bitcoin it was just very very difficult I mean Bitcoin has decided perhaps correctly to make sort of to trade off the expressiveness of the programming language for increased security so they have a very kind of weak algorithm language very deliberate though which provides I think perhaps better security and yeah you know kind of it's more conservative development path but as a result is very hard to build like crowdfunding and I remember when a theorem came out it was like literally one of the like 20 line you know things I think people really underestimate how much the developer abstraction matters so it took my Kern something like eight months to old lighthouse using Bitcoin scripting a theory er C 20 a system like you and I could practically do this on cell phones now I mean it's and that layer of abstraction opens up use cases that I think I think people underestimate how big a deal it is you know it's the same with all computing like you could have done you know there were mobile phones that had GPS and cell phone connectivity pre iPhone but but the iPhone made it so the app developer didn't have to understand any of that stuff worked right you could focus on recruiting drivers and building like a beautiful UI and and to me like I mean obviously the iPhone there's a bunch of great things about the iPhone and Android and what made smart phones take off but a lot of it was that they figured out the right abstraction layer for the developers so that so that you could get a million apps right yeah and a whole bunch of kind of creativity that happened and I actually think we're gonna see the next wave of that now with webassembly or wasum because there have been problems with the etherium solidity language huge security problems and there's not actually as much expressivity as people think there is no it's still limited to solidity you know even you know they even one other language was basically found to be totally insecure so um i think that you know these vm systems moving towards awasum compiler and this is like polka dot Definity II was him so like if you're into I think it's a really big deal so just to explain to people so Bitcoin comes up with this new kind of architecture that I think of as I think it's frankly mischaracterize today as a ledger I think of it as a computing platform so it can put them to a computer and a ledger Ledger's more like a hard drive a computer is a hard drive plus a processor yeah Bitcoin has a processor it's just a processor that has a limited range it but deliberately limited in the applications that can run and it runs and the main application it runs is the thing that moves bitcoins around right a theorem says hey let's take that processor and let's expand it a lot but as you're saying it does it did it they developed their own programming language solidity which is kind of JavaScript like but it's kind of eccentric and just a few but people don't know why azzam so that's web assembly which is now baked into every browser and so sort of you know there are now billions of computers that run wasm natively and it will soon become there already is and and it's going to continue to become the most dominant kind of runtime environment for software in the world yeah and what that means is now that all the block teams are supporting wasm that means that all of these these compilers that are built from other programming languages you know Python rust whatever pick your favorite language you already have all you get to piggyback off of all of the tooling that's been built over the last 20 years other programming languages so you make it a much more kind of familiar experience to developers and so instead of needing to learn solidity which is again this custom language it's it's a pre new language no scheme of things you can use yeah you're off-the-shelf favorite programming language you know to me this is a similar step function that we saw from Bitcoin scripting language then it's also like it's like you know the great thing about Python it's not just like there's there's 10,000 github projects or those formal verification so it's just as an example like why does it take a long time to release an theorum project today like I think at least half the development time probably a security audits yeah right and that's because you know you've got this really kind of this new programming language people don't fully understand it there aren't these kind of tools around it yeah something like Python and you've got just like 20 years of you know for whatever 15 years of incredible tools that are built around that environment yeah that's exactly right and so to me this is one way that we're building useful abstractions to make this even easier to ship like end-user applications yep yeah I mean the big things happening now so I guess kind of jumping forward so I think you and I probably see it similarly there was kind of the first era which was big but it was sort of the means the only thing really in that first year one of the only things then they're sort of a theory Mira which is sort of takes this idea of digital money and expand it to blockchain computers right and now I think what we're seeing over the next twelve months or so maybe 12 to 24 months is the kind of the wave 3 happening right which is taking the ideas of aetherium upgrading the developer experience that you just discussed very importantly upgrading the scalability which means multiple things it means more it probably basically means what what we call on traditional venture capital scale out not scale up so instead of instead of getting scale by adding more a big beefier computer you can get scale by adding more computers to the network right which lets you kind of expand linearly with the demand and that requires what's known as sharding or some Swimmer parallelism that lets you run in and and that's what a lot of these new projects or they're doing better developer experience you things like wasum and just all the other tooling around it they're they're building parallelism in from the start right as opposed to having to upgrade later and and what else I think a third one for me is they're often building the ability to upgrade the protocol into the protocol so the governance of the protocol itself and all the governance of the smart contracts yes exactly so so to me Bitcoin and aetherium and may be you know very much intentionally have not had formal systems to upgrade themselves and that's because it does open up a potential security threat to the system I think an upgrade then who controls that upgrade process but if you can adequately design an upgrade process that is controlled by the same people that already control the consensus lawyer you know it's it's an equivalent threat I was baking a bad block or something like that so to me you know the ability to say actually there's a better system let's upgrade and move to that system in a coordinated manner you know I think that's a really exciting that's the way I think of that is it's there's always a trade-off between the security of the system and the end of it like the very promise of a blockchain computer to me is that it it's making a commitment that the code will continue to run as design they're sort of theoretical tease and you want it of course that maintaining that commitment is very very important but there's a trade-off because software also as we know from you know decades of experience a has bugs and needs to be fixed and B benefits from you know from sort of iterative upgrade cycles right and so how do you balance those two things and so Bitcoin aetherium kind of took the extreme kind of conservative route which said you the only way to upgrade is to kind of get a whole bunch of people to just literally upgrade their software simultaneously which led to all these kind of offline things including sort of famously the Bitcoin civil war and then the theory of hork which was very contentious and so they were kind of built in a way to be very conservative with governance method I think of it as yep and so how do you find the right balance and the people are experimenting and trying new systems yep - to get to get a better balance maybe yeah so I think a big part of this is there are actors in the Bitcoin and aetherium and other other crypto systems that are part of what defines like or the reality of those systems and so you could call these note operators in Bitcoin miners obviously have ever Alta plane and improve of state protocols it's very much the token holders who are staking and we've seen really really strong participation so in a lot of these delegated proof estate protocols you see you know 70 80 % of token holders participating in consensus so they're already defining what is the the latest block and blockchain they're already defining the rules of that computer so in my mind you know how can we say they're gonna we're gonna use a decentralized mechanism to come to consensus about the computer state but we're gonna we're going to also say it's impossible to come to a decision about how to change the rules that computer so I'm very skeptical that we can't achieve very secure on chain governments governance I think we can and to me it's a very big deal because if you get governance right in theory everything else should be a sort of waterfall down from that and you can do very exciting things that I think we haven't done you know I think a big problem for both Bitcoin and aetherium has been funding of core protocol development so application developers have found all sorts of ways to model you can go raise a VC round you can do a token sale yeah you know there's lots of money sloshing around in general if you're building on top of these protocols but if here iam has this weird problem where there's probably a hundred X the number of developers building apps on top as there are building core protocol stuff for aetherium and so to me well that has to do with the history of a theorem right so there was a Foundation which has a certain amount of money but there was never kind of structure so there's no yeah there's no structure and set up to continuously fund the development basically the taxes yeah where if I contribute to the core protocol and create all the Z cash does what they have inflation yanked into the protocol and some portion of that goes goes it which is sort of crude because they did their system is you know it's designed around one team I don't think it's designed to last a hundred years and its current implementation in their defense I don't think they do either yeah yeah I mean I think that they think of it as a as an MVP do it better yeah to a better system yeah and and so in in my mind the ability for developers to contribute new protocol suggestions and basically add a build to them yeah so then I could say if this gets merged in and this actually becomes the new version of the protocol me and my development team are actually going to inflate a certain number of coins they're just can be created it's like dilution basically for the existing holders and they're gonna be rewarded to us and because this is a long-term iterative game between all the token holders and the developers who are going to contribute code to the protocol it's actually in the token holders best interest to pay them and and say okay we're going to pay you guys you know what I accept as an a theorem holder like a 1% dilution to ship aetherium - absolutely right that it's a no-brainer - and so if you could create 1% of the etherium tokens you know and grant those to the development team today that's like what two hundred million dollars it's it's a it's a large what do you what do you say to the skeptics who think that proof of stake will governance will devolve into either like a plutocracy on one hand where the big you know the big investors or whatever like you know whatever doctor see like I control for their own interest and then or or alternatively are vulnerable to bribery tax and other kinds of yeah so I just think that we have relatively at scale proof of sake systems today this is this argument seem better 12 months ago but yeah that's my thing is like you see taze us and cosmos it's like if you can get away with these attacks there are hundred million dollar bounties to go through there's bug I'm just yeah I'm a big believer in economic incentives for these bug bounties I mean if you can attack Tasos and break consensus and get bad blocks through heaven follow the Taser so go to the other people I'm sure they're people trying to attack it oh I'm sure there are and I'm just like if you'll turn attack Bitcoin I'm talking right and these are our highly adversarial environments but in my view proof of stake to me has a few features that I really like about it so one you have no to operator and minor type participants and token holders and in the Bitcoin system we've actually seen cases where these parties don't have the best interests in mind like there's not a perfect overlap for their interests yeah and so in a way you could argue there's like a check and balance or something like that but in a system like chased us or cosmos those are the same people right so the token holders are the validators and I think that just means in general there's going to be a better alignment of interests between the blog reducers and and the token holders the second thing is that if you attack a proof of state network mitigation of the attack after it happens is significantly easier so if you come in with you know 51% of the coins and in most previously it's actually 34% but the coins is enough to attack and you start doing bad things right bad blocks and stuff like that the minority people here can really just hard fork the chain and delete your coins and keep going however the reason they can do that is because that attackers validation was interrupt protocols like within the protocol so you can delete their their stuff and move forward if you do that with hardware and proof-of-work systems you actually have to change the hashing algorithm for the entire proof work chain and burn everything to the ground like for the good guys and the bad guys because you have to fork so that the hardware is now bad forever and so you have to basically punish the good guys and the bad guys to mitigate a proof-of-work so in a proof of work system summarize that ana proof of work system the worst case scenario is you your attack doesn't work and a proof of stake system the worst case scenario is you lose all of your not only your attack of some work but you also lose your entire life savings yeah so it's a much more punitive its measured well it's it's it's it's it's disproportionately punitive to the back I mean proof of stake yeah by the way and so ad also the other thing about proof I mean besides also like the energy uses Oh like it doesn't you know Bitcoin mining destroys all this use waste energy it deliberately does but it's still bad also very for me is a critical thing is you talked about like developer experience and user experience you just simply can't have like sub second transaction finality and a proof of work system yeah like so Bitcoin like you really need to wait you know each block is ten minutes and has to do with the coordination among the network and the network propagation latency and things but also it's a probabilistic method so you really have to wait probably sixty minutes if not longer and from a user experience point of view you know if I send you and it same with the theorems days proof of work you know and you go you if you download quitting this wallet and you try to use some these apps there's a lot of really cool apps it's early but you got to wait 30 seconds yeah for like a after you click a button that's not a modern user experience yeah and the only way we're gonna get to modern user experience is through these kind of proof of state systems they have all these kind of different methods that that give much faster transaction so just I think a whole bunch of reasons why let's get sharding you can't you know one I that I've ever heard of knows how to do sharding and proof yeah I mean I'm so perilous of scaling all these things there's a reason why every you know I think 2017 was a major your fundraising and 2019 is a major year of launches and there's a reason that every blockchain that's launching today it's mostly using premier but the exception of grain and things like this right yeah but those are all just simple transactional they don't have some are contracts they don't have scaling solutions yeah a grain is not it is very much focused on private payments and scalable payments it's not trying to open up a suite of new applications that we're not possible we have folded protocols which to me is the really exciting thing though you know it's it's what is possible there that we haven't seen today because even the etherium developers you know when they ship the protocol in 2015 I don't think any of them could have conceived of the whole ICO wave yeah and you know that was like 12 to 18 months away and it was still hard to see that that was coming to me this is what makes computing interesting right is is there's this interplay if you go look at the PC the internet smartphones I think we're gonna see it's the crypto I think we're gonna see the VR in a couple this year in a couple years there's interplay where you get the platform's get better like in this case we're talking about layer 1 some our contract platforms right which are the ones we're talking about that haven't like coming out of the next 12 to 18 months and those are kind of equivalent of the Apple 2 or the iPhone or whatever in this world but the median that's cool that's great and we're into that right but the really cool part is all of the crazy stuff that people like no one imagined it's really funny if you go back and look at the early like Apple to add so Appleton came out in 77 you know pcs didn't really take off for six years and for those like six year people try and figure what do you do with you say and all the old ads are really funny they're always have like people at the kitchen table doing the recipes and like yeah your companies didn't really know but then the developers came along and invented word processing spreadsheets you know all this other cool stuff and so that to me is what's really like right now we're seeing a little bit on the application side but it's limited because the the platforms the layer ones Marc contract platforms just aren't there yeah right so we can't you can't really I mean we're seeing cool stuff we'll talk about it today like in d5 for examples finance where the maybe the the performance parameters are looser and things they don't need is the kind of kind of form change for other things but what's really gonna get exciting to me is that period of like yep hopefully a year or two from now when we've got a great platform then we just see this explosion of creativity yeah well and the big thing is people need to untether themselves from thinking only in terms of efficiency improvements of existing processes so like early use cases for Bitcoin and people talked about a lot it's basically cost savings of remittance or cost savings of micro payments or something like that but that's really looking at existing use cases and applications that like a recipe book yeah and saying oh let's put this on the computer it always happens about it yeah like you look at early web and yeah they took magazines and they or they put brochures and they put them on the web but that's just how people think and then only it took you to Google 10 years to realize wait this is a two-way medium yeah all things to generate a content in YouTube and what I really care about are what are going to be the native apps that are only possible with blockchains and they're also that you know the other thing is people are very caught on the web to model people are talking about daily active users but of like financial products it's just odd thing so like are you a daily active user of your mortgage right it's like the wrong framework it's just a round question right but you know to me I think the reason everyone was so focused on di use for web 2 was because the main business model was advertising and that was driven but it was a proxy for what the business model was all right but but ultimately if you have a business model that is not depend on da use that's not your manager yeah exactly and so it to me I just think we're gonna see this iteration and explosion of basically you know financial services and finance but at the speed of open-source software development which is really really fast and it's highly iterative and it's like a big shared you know open code repository that people are building on so to me the innovation here is going to be very very fast I mean it already has been but it will continue to be and the thing I look forward to is what what have you know what's going to happen that is sort of unimaginable today and sort of by definition wasn't possible with the old architecture I think you know to me one of the there are many kind of cool sci-fi things in crypto I think one of the coolest things is the idea of kind of code software that has an agency or a sort of autonomous software so you think about you know maker today or compound and this idea that the code itself actually controls money and has business processes and logic and it's not the code that's run by it's not like code you know Google code control stuff - or PayPal does but it's not really the code that does it right they're just the instrument through which the management of that company execute their will here the code itself actually is autonomous right and is no longer controlled it's controlled this is the this is the sort of idea to me the key idea of a blockchain is that the code continues to run as designed and it has sort of game theoretic guarantees it will yep right yeah and that gives code this autonomous these autonomous not in the sense of like AI sense of like having money and self-control and runs forever as we speak right now these contracts on a theorem of running and doing things and you know distributing money or collecting money or running other business logic a rough but potentially useful analogy is thinking about the corporate structure so like the idea of a corporation in theories that it kind of runs forever and management can turn over and there's different types of capital formation to keep it funding in a rhythm and it's all through legal contracts and you in certain regions right so the the corporation as a legal entities always sort of registered with the state in a specific geographic region and it's all papered through legal contracts but you know could a system like that that coordinates capital from many many different people and outlives any of the individual people could that move to a pure software system using as you said sort of autonomous software instead of these legal contracts that are based in specific geographic regions can it be sort of sovereign to the internet you know these are the types of ideas that it sounds crazy today but when you when you think about this sort of history of the corporation and the liquid stock markets that we have you know the all these concepts that we think of as that you know they've been around forever they're really only about 100 hundred years old or something like this to me then an obvious question is why would you want that and to me the answers are one it one is very important you mentioned before it's open source the fact that all this all of these things were discussing they're all available by definitely you they have to be if they're on aetherium like they have to be open you can go read the github code yeah if you can't do it yourself you can have somebody else do it right so it's completely open but then another very important feature is is this what we call compositionality our composability is the idea that you can have one organization here and I can take that and I can build another one on top of it take a reference is it yeah and I know I can do it and that's the only reason I can do that a couple things one is it software that can you can actually like all the functions and things like that it's open source and so I can audit it and trust it but the third thing is because the code itself sort of exists on its own I know I can build on top of it and like the code will continue to operate that way and there won't be some whimsical change in business strategy but you know by the owners of the exact wish to me like that that like it's just that I guess and this is informed partly through my experience in a non crypto tech it's just so much there's so many issues created around platforms and around trusting platforms and so you think about you know Zingo building on Facebook and like the hundreds of entrepreneurs who tried to build on top of Twitter and just like it would have been so cool if to me if Twitter you know we're the sort of open protocol the way SMTP email is yeah and you could have you know someone could build the you know the superhuman of yeah Twitter as opposed to you know and the anti people are complaining about spam on Twitter why aren't there why isn't there a third-party marketplace with spam filters the way there is with email clients you know this used to be and just like all the kind of cool stuff that you get like and you see in the open source world now where it's like Lego bricks and you're building these buildings out of the different bricks and every piece of code is a new Lego brick and then you get this kind of combinatorial explosion of innovation yep one and this is I think a lot of people get caught up or confused on this decentralisation is not an ideological thing it's an architecture to support that permissionless building this is why the internet was so big is is if there was like an intranet and Microsoft owned it like Microsoft MSN your Microsoft and app back in the day we would never have seen it I was on Google and in all these companies grow like they have so to me that that decentralized architecture of all these systems it's not like an ideological thing it's really just an architecture that allows developers to build anything they want and as you said it's all sort of permanent and it's like if every data structure on the entire Internet what's open yeah and except had an open API we've seen we've seen the power of the kind of composability in the open source world now in the in the traditional OpenSocial world meaning like Linux and Apache and all those other stuff you know that that has been a phenomenal success 90 plus percent of the software in the world today is open source every you know the bulk of the software in your iOS phone bulkier software Android phone every data center why is open source done so well because because you can remix it right you can take the piece of code and you can do stuff with it and it just gets this you know it starts off you go back to the like when Linux came out and like whatever early 90s it was definitely worse in Windows but they just followed this much faster like innovation curve because of this this this the fact that you can compose these Lego bricks together and you had just anyone the world could come contribute some smart person and some random place can see some bug and fix it just like all those effects and now but but but the problem was open source still depended on the goodwill or this financial interest of somebody to actually run the code and then that's of course where AWS and Google cloud stepped in like we're gonna actually run it because open source was just code right yeah but and whereas blockchains our code instantiated right it's code that's running and doesn't depend on the kindness of strangers or capitalists to to run it and therefore can't be usurped in the same way and it's just much more powerful because it keeps state and has data and does and as computing ability and just all these other things that open source didn't have so to me it's like the best of those two worlds is like all the power of a modern computer and then and then the composability that made open source is successful yep yep and I I do think that people underestimate just the scope of types of applications that will come out of this I think that you know this idea of a global unified internet money is one of the basics it's and it's a very very big deal and if we do have these sort of decentralized autonomous corporations or something they're going to be using the Internet money in order to communicate among each other and create financial contracts and things like that but it's it's this is why this is such an exciting area because it just feels like the possibilities are served limitless so what um so let's talk about the the kind of the state of the world right now too so you know I think the New York Times just to just talk about how you know they think the crypto is over and there's all these sort of negative articles about it as usual yeah I've been reading these since I've been reading these for almost ten years I've been reading these about the internet too for even longer and technology longer um but but it has been there has been a price downturn you know I don't know some maybe some of the excitements down or something I don't know but so kind of I guess what I'm getting at is where are we in the in the lifecycle of this kind of yes so I do think that 2017 was a year of new financial instruments and it was actually I think a lot of people underestimate how small how small of an amount of money was available 2016 and before that for cryptocurrency and blockchains the whole universe was just pretty small you know there was no billion dollar company anywhere it was really just a sort of Nishi thing and for that reason there just wasn't a lot of capital available now the people that were very excited though about cryptocurrencies are the people using cryptocurrency but I do think that we saw a huge amount of funding and projects that had been in the works for many many years how to funding my this coin and so then you know I think 2019 is turning out to be the year of launches we've just seen these hugely ambitious projects actually get to across the finish line and cosmos is a great example launched just about a month ago and it's sort of the first system we've ever seen that will allow cross blockchain interaction so we've always had these kind of siloed logic and state in say aetherium and now you could have smart contracts or tokens on aetherium transfer like to other block chains potentially it also gives you a scaling story because you can have you can have it's almost kind of like chart you have different block chains that can sort of I think we think of is it heterogeneous shards as opposed to you sure yeah yeah sweet shard can everyone its own language that's exactly right and and so the development momentum feels very strong to me and we're going to see a lot of very very exciting launches in 2019 however I think that will be two very little fanfare it's kind of like if you're iam launched in you know the middle of crypto winter in 2015 and nobody cared you know it's not like if you're in watching was it well it's not your times it's not like you're gonna launch it and it's gonna be an overnight success you need to then it's it I think of these is a two step go to market so the first step is getting developers right and so and you got to build that community and I got to build tools and you got to build like you just think about all the stuff that we take for granted probably in the theorem world of like you know wallets and you know IDs and debuggers and just like you know ether scan and just like the whole like a secret like caching you alchemy stopped cashing tools or what is a whole set of again structure right so that's got to get built you've got to get people fired up you've got to have like hackathons you've got to people got to learn the you know do tutorial just there's a whole set of things have to happen and so even when you launch these these new layer ones I think it's probably I know at least twelve months probably before you see like higher quality applications coming out the other thing about about as you know with these with these because the code is autonomous because once you write it it's out there you really have to get security right and some of that those improvements will come through better programming languages and tools but it also just takes longer I hear people compare it to kind of hardware development versus software development like you can't do you build faulty hardware you have to recall it physically hey ya know faulty SAS software you can fix a few things and deploy and so it just takes a while so so I think yeah do I share your feeling that this will be a year of launches however it will be more of a developer kind of phenomenon then yeah yeah I do think it'll take ya twelve months as I've said before we see a lot of the ways that these will be used in surprising manners right i I do think that aetherium was very exciting when it came out but I really do think even the people that built aetherium didn't couldn't properly predict exactly how it would be used and these these use cases are like eighteen months down the line it's not that far around the corner this is one thing I love about cryptocurrency is if you miss like three months you're already behind on on the scope of kind of what is possible and and what is happening so we talked about application so what do you so like I think the thing that's working the most probably on a theorem today is is defy the centralized finance right and unless maybe let's talk a little your site about and then like other other types of applications so I do think that one of the very big things being built on aetherium that's exciting our stable coins and particularly for me it's crypto collateralized stable coins where the the stable coin that's paid to say the dollar or but it really couldn't be anything any asset that's not endogenous to the blockchain so it could be a Google stock or it could be S&P 500 it could be a bond whatever whatever it might be the backing for that value is a smart contract that's holding you know etherium compatible assets and this is like the maker Dowell system I think it's a really really big deal because a lot of the use cases that people originally envisioned for cryptocurrencies related to financial services or payments have this significant problem which is just the volatility so even ecommerce with something as volatile as Bitcoin you said like the one hour you wait until you have to actually close and receive those bitcoins I mean yeah margin on e-commerce often is pretty low right you might be getting four five percent well the volatility in an hour and Bitcoin can be more than that so I do think that these stable coins are critical for other types of applications and so the augur prediction markets you know other even just like token trading you know what is the base pair you're trading against in a decentralized exchange is it ether against some of their anymore I think also like you just think about lending for example people don't you know exactly if your costs if you're buying a house in dollars you want your one yeah you want your stable coin peg to dock and the stable coin can actually then act as collateral in other types of use cases so I do think that stable coins are like I think also the vehicle Billy I mean the other thing about maker Dow that's interesting is just how it's a very interesting kind of economic structure for how they enforce the peg and how they kind of incentivize the ecosystem and that and the fact that that runs in a smart contract which holds a significant amount of money is just a it's just a real I think to me a testament to the to the power of the etherium design and the sort of what smart contract platforms can do it's one of many examples but but and one and it's gotten traction like it's gotten more traction I think people realize as in it's about 2% of all ether is is held in the maker Dow contract and now that's hard capped by the protocol so they could take off that cap and when I say they I mean actually the MKR holders who vote on these changes and so if they wanted to potentially massively increase the amount of ether locked in that contract they really could now I do think it almost starts to create systemic risk at around say 5% of all ether I mean for the etherion protocol for the maker tower protocol so you don't want half of all ether held in this thing but in just sheer dollar terms you know there's hundreds of millions of dollars locked in this protocol that people are basically using to get a loan and so it's it's well these defy things are very very hard to use it's kind of a disaster from a UX perspective you have to download all this software you have to have ether you know and you have to click through a million different things and have a mental model for what you're doing and you have to I mean it's a testament to how hardcore the enthusiasts yeah but yeah exactly and you know I think a lot of them are arbitrage errs and folks like that that are just doing kind of profit seeking behavior but it's yeah I mean to me we are seeing kind of the early success of some of these low-level stable Coyne systems and I think that stable coins are going to be a critical part of the recipe for a lot of more abstracted higher-level use cases I think of it as our friend Balaji has a kind of framework I like which is you know you think about he what he would say I think is that the idea that you'd buy a cup of coffee using a cryptocurrency is sort of the one of the least interesting abuse cases and he has this kind of model where it's kind of U shaped where it's on the one hand there's about a billion and a half people that have smartphones but are unbanked are not part of the Internet economy and for those people that's it's very interesting to have a digitally native currency right and architectural it makes a lot of sense because one of the key features of cryptocurrencies it's a bearer instrument meaning the recipient can verify that they got they got paid using just sort of math and the internet they're not having to rely on a bank or some third party and therefore doesn't need an ID and there's a fraud risk and everything else so that's sort of the one end that where the stuff so powerful and then the other end is is in the high kind of high end of the software developers and you now have programmable money programmable loans a program it's all these kind of cool new things you can do on the innovation side yeah and I think of it as like what if like here's a sort of a metaphor but like like the fact that that photos are just a file format that you can send the people allowed people to invent Facebook and Instagram and if instead if you know this is again a metaphor but like if instead you had to kind of get permission every time you sent a photo which if it was a service and not a file format like there would have been way less innovation around the kind of media or the last 20 years now now what if money is a file format it's just a string of bits it's just a string a bit it's no longer a web service that's connected to PayPal or Visa or something and they can't take their money and screw it up or do whatever they want and I make you get permission and make them get you know and like and disenfranchised and building a half people and everything else like you know now it's just bits and like what can you do it's a very powerful concept it is and I I do think that you know the the an interesting feature of cryptocurrencies for me is that the people that become knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies I would say about ninety-five percent of them or more I think it's a good idea once you become knowledgeable about it and so to me a lot of this is just an education process I was like how how do we get more and more people to recognize why cryptocurrencies have this extremely unique value it's the most misunderstood I've I feel like tech has often misunderstood but this is by far the money so that I've worked in by far the modality between the reality and the perception and partly a self-inflicted wound yeah because of the kind of early crypto movement and it was you know a lot of kind of political anarchist types got into it and things but it's that's lingered and it's just really misunderstood yeah it's very well I agree with you I have this I have this would go over and over again special people that are technical you give them like the theorem white paper or the file and white paper whatever you know just got you the Bitcoin white paper and they come back and they're like oh my god this is totally different than what people described to me and what I exactly nothing like because it's easy to pay attention to of course the bad actors prices and stuff when in reality the kind of fundamental development yeah like you said from Bitcoin to this more general computer to the more advanced applications that again like file coin being this low-level building block that's going to enable all sorts of new behaviors because just thinking about file coin like how am I supposed to build any sort of decentralized application I can't do file storage right it's kind of this basic building block but I can't build twitter the protocol or uber the protocol to compete with the centralized web platform unless I have a decentralized file architecture underneath it which today is not really possible and so these low-level systems it's it's really remarkable the rippling implications of what will become possible and I do think that the number one barrier is just very simply education this is an esoteric and complex area and there's also a huge amount of smoke and mirrors right I do think that there are have always been in the crypto space its its international and its permissionless so there's just a lot of crazy behaviors and crazy characters and it's easy to focus on on that stuff yep that's actually one of the good things about the price downturn is I think it's cleaned up a lot of that yeah and sort of put the focus back on innovation and technology yeah yeah I agree I think that these sort of builders of all this stuff never really stopped but they're also you know not who the media necessarily pays attention to I think that the media tends to be a reflection of the investors and the investors tend to be really short-sighted and focused very much on month-to-month or even day-to-day tech volatility yeah so one interesting trend is what would kind of what we call vertically integrated applications and you know something we've been talking about and and I think the way I think about it is sometimes when you don't have the full kind of tech stack built out sometimes for a project to kind of get adoption they need to build more themselves so like a good historical example is blackberry they come up with a with an email smart phone in 2003 and the time you didn't have sort of a great smartphone platform like the iPhone you didn't have great connectivity you didn't have great back-end so they build the whole thing they built this hardware they built the software they built the network they built the backend and they were able to kind of get kind of I think it was like pulled a future forward you know eventually you get to do this by building an app on the iPhone but like at the time you couldn't so they had to build at all and I think we're seeing some of that pattern now because we don't have all the layers you know kind of at the at the ideal state now particularly like the layer one smart contract left one more time with earlier just we don't have kind of a great scaleable everything else the I mean the old wisdom was sort of build a low level yeah you know extensible protocol and developers will come and build all the useful apps and I think a great example of that was the 0x protocol system which is like token trading on a theorem using a smart contract so they said we're not going to own sort of the end user interface we're gonna build a low-level system and then different people are going to come build web interfaces I think the the newer generation of these smart contract developers we've seen say we're gonna build that low-level protocol but we're also going to own the user interface and kind of build that full stack experience and that vertical integration is you put it I think is potentially going to be a catalyst for a lot of stuff to move a little bit faster than it has historically and so there's the project's ello that's working on first a kind of low level stable coin designed for payments and remittances as well as an Android kind of mobile first application designed for folks that don't have access to traditional banking or financial services and so by owning kind of both pieces they can kind of iterate a bit faster and potentially understand the full scope of how the customers is using this platform and and provide kind of a modern user and user experience that you would hope for from a non kind of blockchain app and they'll provide kind of a similar user experience but then also I think have the kind of the what I think is the modern crypto business model of you know they own some of the coins and they ultimately want to see the tokens appreciate and don't need to and and therefore are okay with other people for example starting to build their own apps and you like and supplanting their app they don't need to control the end-to-end thing all the way in the future because they have this business model that's aligned with the case it's being fighting the community the way live was a model where like the more you give away the are you doing for yourself which is obviously in web - it was kind of own everything and fight but so it's cinching because it started to model a sort of start web to like just to get the user experience right but then but then have the business model that's sort of web 3 and therefore lets you have this great property of growth the PI not fight over the PI yeah exactly ok so that's a that's and then and then I guess one of the thing we haven't covered is we talked about payments we talked about centralized finance we talked a little bit about like file coin and kind of what I would call incentivized infrastructures like kind of new infrastructure that has incentives built in what are some of the areas that that you know kind of application area is one thing with with these crypto protocols is you can build markets for anything yeah and so anything today that's sort of a one-to-one service with for example in the case of final coin Amazon Web Services Microsoft is ooh or whatever Google Cloud you can turn that into a competitive marketplace that sort of unifies all of these and so while file coin builds this competitive spot market for file storage you could have a similar thing for many of these kind of low-level computer resources so you could do that for compute you could do that I think a I'd a that would be very interesting one yeah we're a genetic dating right so then you could even where's the AI like excuse me a critical question in the next ten years as where as a idea to live does it live in Google and Amazon servers or is it an open protocol where you know anyone can access it and there's some incentive model for providing it and forgetting it when an interesting intersection is homomorphic encryption which allows you to train a machine learning system based on data that you actually don't know the plaintext so you only see the encrypted version it allows people to say okay I'm going to share the data from my Tesla or my smartphone with a major corporation and get paid for that data and that corporation will actually never learn the data but can still train the machine learning algorithm it's a bit abstract you know and I think it's early on that type of use case but it's potentially you know very transformed I think also you know you could architect social networks marketplaces like ride-sharing all of this stuff could be architected using these methods and I think there would be benefits to all sorts of community members kind of stakeholders including the drivers and riders and so that's a separate maybe a longer conversation but yeah yeah yeah yeah I do think the value accrual when these things succeed go to the entire Lord oh and they're governed by the larger business exactly but you know instead of basically an extractive corporation that owns the platform and at the end of the day has some level of an adversarial relationship with its users I mean it's today yes Facebook loves its users but also it wants to put as many ads in front of the users as it possibly can which actually disrupt the user experience so it's yeah it's it's it's an odd relationship I think that these web 2 platforms have with their user bases I think another interesting area is its its fault its kind of out of fashion in a moment but I think we'll come back is NF TS or you know digital goods it's always been you know there was a hole and if you were around for this but the during when world of warcraft was a big deal there was this whole kind of underground market called farming so people wanted to instead of having to you know earn your way up to level 70 people wanted to buy their way and it was this whole thing where like people would these off game X protocol websites where you could go do this it was a big deal and so a similar idea is to sort of take that in legitimated and say hey you can earn you know in a game or in a virtual world or in some other kind of experience you know what if there are goods that the user can actually own and take from one game to another and buy and sell them and you add economic incentives and you can make a living doing this and you can actually own these things in a way that you can't today today you're really just kind of borrowing them and these games will come and go and they'll you'll spend all this time earning stuff and it'll all then disappear you'll forget about it and this is just a much kind of more it's much more like the offline world like when you get stuff you keep it yeah and yeah and people it's really popular in the offline world I mean they're rippling implications of it are are are big too so if you can own your avatar and you can own the Avatar sword and shield everything other like we tell it earlier everything is interoperable it's like an open API so any developer can then build an expansion pack or a mod on the game it turns like the modding community around various games into like a real economic system and so then you could actually imagine like in in the longer term it's almost like think about every like rupee you've ever earned it in game or every bit of gold imagine if that was actually all unified among like almost every game right and they were like secondary markets between one game in another game and you could actually maybe bring your avatar from one game to another game there's just you know it's almost like turning the universe of video games into Minecraft right obviously that's a sort of far future but I do think this this open and interoperable low level systems do you enable that type of you also the other cool thing is with with the economic incentives you suddenly for example you could imagine funding your game instead of going to Activision and ask him for money you can fund your game by pre selling some of the goods yep you could have third-party creators who are in living some person you know whatever with the smartphone is designing virtual goods and selling them and earning a living okay well in one of the most successful categories on Kickstarter is kick-starting video games because you know gamers are hardcore they and they want to support independent developers now imagine if you could take that from I'm just gonna buy your game so I'm actually gonna invest in your game right it's way more powerful and it aligns the the interest between the gamers and and the indie developers so to me yeah it could be a very big trend and we have seen some level of that and I think one of the problems was you know when you can pre-sell these game items you get this investor community rather than the gaming community interested and so I do think it's important to you know make sure that it's not it's like it's a people who actually want to play the game right that are that are sort of buying those game items but I do think that the interoperability of avatars and items and levels and stuff like that is is a big deal yeah all right awesome thanks things off here yeah thanks for having me Chris"}, {"id": "J9xFj07lGOI", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9xFj07lGOI", "title": "Trends in Blockchain Research with Don Tapscott", "channel": "Girl Gone Crypto", "duration": "24:10", "views": 237, "published": "5 months ago", "transcript": " hey everyone and welcome back to my channel girl gone crypto I have an awesome guest here today we've got Don Tapscott who is truly I think a legend in this space and I'm really honored to have you here on my channel so Don thank you so much for coming and hang it out I'm happy to be here as it were so we started chatting on Twitter I think originally because you commented on a ukulele video that I shared and you said that you played the ukulele as well so I think that's super fun how long have you been playing the ukulele forum well actually I'm mainly a keyboard player I have a band it's called men in suits and we used to do a concert every year whether a public demanded it or not but then we got good we raise money for good causes would probably raise four five million dollars over the years and it's a lot of fun so I put mainly play keyboard organ and piano and stuff since synth in that band I also play guitar but if you can play guitar you can play ukulele so but my son alex has just picked up the ukulele and then we bought him one for his birthday present he's getting quite proficient at it that's what I love about the ukulele is its I feel like it the entry point is easy but it sounds actually pretty cool and it makes a great gift like you said you know you can just kind of have fun and jam with someone so I want to talk about the blockchain Research Institute just to kind of kick off and for anyone who maybe hasn't seen your TED talk as well I'll make sure to link to that below you had a viral TED talk talking about you know back in 2016 talking about how blockchain is changing both money and business and then you've co-founded the blockchain Research Institute so maybe just to kick off tell us a little bit about what that is and what kind of research you guys are focusing on these days well after Alex I wrote the book on blockchain revolution we we created the blockchain research institute it actually came about from a meeting up here my country place the background behind me is where I am and we brought together a bunch of leaders from the various platforms and and other players in blockchain and was sort of a come-to-jesus kind of situation where we said you've got a we've got to solve this problem of all the warring factions and everything in the industry and to large extent it has been so on this great progress but we we created something called the Muskoka group and I think if you go the Muskoka record you can see the principles of a group of people this cottage is in Muskoka and one of the action items was that we need to have better case research and better research done them would be helpful to large enterprises and governments so Alex and I after that we we thought what the hell let's do it so we created the blockchain Research Institute within two months we have 15 large companies that each kicked in a hundred and fifty K or 200k in many cases and so that gave us enough money to get going we've now got 70 companies and we're doing a hundred and ten projects creating 300 research deliverables it's the largest independent think-tank in the world on blockchain if a small staff 16 people but fact faculty 60 faculty all around the world and the the location there's blockchain Research Institute dot org now I'm just uh you mentioned my TED talk and I just pulled it up here Wow four million five hundred and sixty four thousand people that's just on ted.com I have you know like being up people actually watch this thing but once things start going in China the numbers get really crazy I was actually the last time I was there I went on CCTV 2 which is the second China Network largely for business and someone sent me a clip from their website I had three million likes not views likes and no idea how many views that is but amazing things going on there so if anyone's listening to this they wanted to know more just go to blockchain Research Institute dot org and if you do you'll actually find all our latest research on blockchain and pandemics which we've made publicly available so how much research is publicly available versus it sounds like the majority is probably for various clients so is the majority of the work that you're doing for particular research projects that a certain client needs or do you share the research between various companies no we the way it works is everybody puts money in the pot and then we do these hundred and ten projects and they all get the results of very soon named results they can customize the work they can ask for a special research report and every member for their 200k also gets an executive briefing by me or Alex now originally that was anywhere in the world but now or have having to do that online however that was a good question because what we do is the each research project the deliverables report infographic video PowerPoint data set each report is proprietary to the members only for a period of six to twelve months and then we make it available publicly under Creative Commons license so yeah and the people to watch chain Research Institute org you'll find this and you this is all the stuff that we're doing on pandemics and then if you go into the research projects it will tell you you can explore the research and that's just an example of something new but you can also view the public research and there's a feast that live millions and millions every one of these is a fifty two hundred thousand dollar project that we've released to the public Wow that's absolutely incredible and honestly such a huge component of what is needed to help move the space forward especially looking you know more enterprise block chaining these big big companies being willing to get into the space and just in general like what kind of topics do you think have been the most requested or wanted in terms of things that needed additional research all right now the pandemic stuff is on Fuego you know we can print it fast enough no yeah it's bit of goods itself but I don't know some of the really big topics and they've been all over the place you know really an example invented the smart contract was our project leader on smart contracts in this piece is a lot of people of read back there there's a lot of we're doing a bunch of pieces on regulation now we're doing a lot of pieces on the environment projects of organizing carbon credits fisheries the ocean plastic all kinds of stuff like that there's a big interest in them the financial services work is also very much in demand I'd say it's kind of all over oh one other thing I remember the current we do release some of the reserve the results to the public in a new special form which is called about now look at this stupid means the Greeks came back looking around behind me not gonna work there are two very cool books one is called a supply chain revolution and the other there is called the financial services revolution I edited the one and on supply chain it just came out and alex has edited the book on on the financial services revolution but they're both gorgeous looks and very very proud of yeah I I actually would really I was looking at the financial services revolution book and that's something I've put on my reading list because I think that it just it looks like such an in-depth and thoughtful response to kind of the future of what financial services could look like so I guess in general like what what are some of the biggest takeaways that you would want people that you think people will get from that book financial sure well the opening chapter that's a huge third book by Alex talks about the nine things that the financial industry does know it identifies value that's a dollar that's a stock you are lule\u00e5 if it moves down and because of moves value gets the store value because it stores it gets to lend value it gets to to invest in value venture capital you know private equity mutual funds hedge funds angel investing and so on it gets to audit and account for value all the auditing companies it insures value with insurance and the insurance companies and it analyzes there's a big huge analytics industry and all of those are being transformed they serve goes and talks about all the big things that are happening and then he gets into this whole question of money big time because there are these three categories of cryptocurrency they're the community ones that's which is where it all started with Satoshi the coin and so on and this Alec says in the book the amazing thing about Bitcoin is it worse but then there are the corporate currencies like Facebook's Libre and Facebook and get away with that and it's big if that becomes largest the largest financial institution in the world customers but and then there's this new thing now the central bankers will carry currencies are state-based fiat currencies and there's a big initiative around that we just did a webinar at the Bri we're doing weekly webinars now and we had Christian Carlo it was the recently retired chair of the CFTC that the Commodities Futures Exchange in the US and he's created the digital dollar project and there's a lot of interest in the digital dollar too so that's the first book that analyzes all that stuff and then the other book the supply chain book is the first to talk about supply chains and and pandemics it's called supply chain revolution and so when it comes to you know you're working with all of these obviously large organizations and governments and you know you've just mentioned the digital dollar like one thing that I'm kind of curious about cuz I feel like there's a lot of debate within the crypto community about whether something like this is good whether Libre whether the digital dollar is this are those types of more centralized crypto currencies a positive thing for the space or a negative thing for the space well it depends basically there's a role for each and many people say well we're you know Bitcoin and all the rest is a crap or we leave or and we're gonna dominate everything we're you know we're gonna be the US dollar and that's gonna win out and I don't think any of those views is correct for for Facebook to implement Libre that would be an extraordinary thing would bring a few hundred million people into the global banking system there's a lot of people who are doing on the bank account but they have a Facebook account and they may have a supercomputer in the pocket as well so you can see in theory at least how that could be very positive same with a central bank digital currency now it depends on its implement you want to build privacy into that for example in otherwise Orwell had no idea what was possible it was so cute he talked about cameras Jesus how about knowing your heart people's heart rate real-time you know or or what they're you know what they're where they are or what they think and what they're doing what they're buying and what they're learning what medication they're taking and all the resins so all this data constitutes our digital identity and so which is another big theme that we've been working on recently so I think there's a role for each of them now one thing you speak quite a bit you know it seems and give keynotes at various events and conferences and obviously with this pandemic that has shifted quite a bit I know we were both just part of a virtual blockchain week the bad crypto guys put on how do you see the kind of conference and speaking industry changing coming out of this pandemic do you think that more conferences will just end up staying virtual or do you think that people are really itching to kind of get back out there and get in person again well I think they're itching but there's sort of a PSTD PTSD healer you know like anybody planning a cruise before all right trying to get into a movie theater so we have a big event do you know it's called blockchain revolution global and it's about blockchain in the enterprise and it was supposed to be in April we postponed it until the end of October but to hedge our bets it's going to be a very hybrid event it's going to look more like a TV show some interactive studio audiences rather than a big sort of convention center type of end so I think that that business travel will decline and also we've learned that we can use this pretty effectively I mean you know if you had to fly up here to interview me or something like that you had a nice quality video interview and I can you know do stuff like this so there's the picture of the book and Alex's book and then this is the supply chain book which is just come out and these two are coming out shortly as well but you can buy this on Amazon and that's a beautiful book as well sorry I digress no I love it and I think you make a really great point about we've learned a lot in this pandemic about how to efficiently communicate you know remotely and through video and that actually I mean obviously people we want to get back together in person but from an economic standpoint you know it's it's a lot cheaper to be able to do some of these options yeah there's all the human cost of all of this you know mm-hmm like I never thought I'd want to be on another airplane you know I've been averaging 150 200 flights a year Wow recently as last year and I'm did I was just so happy to not be under planes but now I wouldn't mind it at all and I think that honestly there was a sort of the Portuguese word is soul Dodge it's sort of like a longing you know for personal interaction I mean I'm looking at you on the screen here and I'm thinking yeah this is a very efficient interview but it might be nice to actually sit down yeah nice to faith so I don't know there'll be a lot of other changes to online education is is here for good yeah yeah I'll tell you it's going to run on time here but I'll tell you a funny story I'm dating myself and when I did my graduate degree in 1977 I took an online course in a graduate course in statistics there was no lecture the statistics lecture by definition is a bust everything everyone in the class either they don't get it or they're bored there's no one-size-fits-all for statistics but I work interactively was a dumb term oh and there was a little slow slide thing that showed me graphs and stuff it was connected into the data center in the university and it was self-paced interactive I went through stuff I didn't understand till I got it and I got an a I was never been it's just it's all of a sudden I was really good and I ended up getting a scholarship to paint from my entire graduate program because I ate I was the top student in that course and I thought wall lectures are gonna be totally gone in a decade we're all gonna be learning online and still today you know you have to keep them statistics from explaining an analysis of variance you know to a room of hundreds of students it's ridiculous so so now we're all having to do this so you may know we've got a big program called blockchain and the enterprise yeah it's about it's about the it's the big-business course on blockchain it's done through Coursera and it's also through a partnership with INSEAD as well spent a million dollars on this thing we and there was a really big effort to do it honestly and there was 250 videos or 250 exams and it's a it's a gorgeous thing the take up was kind of okay but now the thing is exploding it's clean coupled it's quintupled in views in the last well here it is here and this is I gave a speech the I Triple E this morning I'll let your viewers in on this but here 25% off Shh the next link if you go to car Sarah org promo blockchain revolution and and that'll that'll get you into the course so anyway so some people are just loving this thing I just did a little virtual graduation ceremony break before this hahaha some students in Europe who wanted to celebrate the fact that they'd all completed the course I said with that No so I bestowed their degrees upon them oh that's great thank you so much for sharing that I'll definitely make sure that people know that that's there and available and I know that we are just about out of time but you I just have one last question I know that you have about a million different things going on it seems you're constantly building and writing books and creating courses and doing different things what is what is the thing you're most excited about that you're working on right now topic or just what is the project that you're most excited about that you're working on well I think there are two big issues facing the planet you don't know the first one and be surprised in a second the first one is client a change then we need to reduce carbon by 80% near 2050 or else we're toast and even if we do it's going to take a thousand years for the planet to cool down and you can expect bad things to have for the next decade over a billion people lose the most of their water supply so this is like do you think we have a problem now no migrations of Taylors in the conflict so and so we need to mobilize a planet so I'm involved in something called carbon xca that's tokenizing carbon credits a anyway that's a big issue for me and then the the other big issue you'll be surprised you me say this is I think that our digital identities we create them but others capture them and this is we need to get our identities back so that we can manage them responsibly for ourselves the virtual Leah knows more than you do by you that you can't remember what you said a year ago where you were you're going to let you gotten a Tesla medication you had or what diagnosis you had or you know what your weight or your your location so on and you create this data but it gets expropriated by these digital landlords kind of like futile ISM you know and you create the value they let you keep a little bit well Leah you get left with a cabbage or two and you can't so you can't use it your data to plan your life and how cool would that be you can't monetize it it's not secured it's going to be hugs we can't get summary data so in a in a pandemic we can't get health data for an entire population is everything is in little silos as an example and the big problem is our privacy is being undermined people say well privacy's dead get over it I think that's ignorance privacy is the foundation of freedom and we need to get our private our identity lieutenant he's back for ourselves so this is a huge theme of mine and I'm working on it we're doing a lot of work on this so expect to see the book and the podcasts and the TV series and the tractor trailer Roadshow satellite you know whatever because when I get my teeth into an issue I really get into it well Don thank you so much for taking the time to come here on my show and just to share all of the amazing things that you are working on and share your insight into the space and so thank you again we really appreciate it I'll put links to everything we talked about below so that people can check it out further great I'll make a big deal of it it was very nice to interview next time who knows crazy crazy things can happen wouldn't that be great we can even maybe jam on the ukulele or something three tenors the two you collabs get Alex involved the three ukuleles it's a band it's a deal alright thanks so much Don I appreciate it"}, {"id": "iLboQSs-r_M", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLboQSs-r_M", "title": "Webinar- Latest Blockchain Trends and Industry Use Cases", "channel": "Techracers Blockchain Development Company", "duration": "23:36", "views": 243, "published": "2 years ago", "transcript": " hello everyone thank you for participating in our webinar today on latest blockchain trends and industry news cases by tech racers I am Lata here chief marketing officer Tech Research and I have a good our CEO who will be our speaker today on this webinar let me tell you a little about what exactly we do so tech racers are leaders in providing end-to-end blockchain solutions and services and help businesses built revolutionary models and practices for the new era of digital economy in order to create value for the customers so payal good hello everyone okay so I'm gonna let start because you know there has been a lot of hype around blockchain and people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies and I'm sure that blockchain technology is beyond cryptocurrencies so how would you define blockchain in the simplest of terms um well actually blockchain is a subset of something called as distributed nature technology so first let us understand what is nature is a ledger is an accounting term so basically a balance book where you maintain a list of all your transaction is called a ledger also what is distributed ledger means distributed ledger means that the copy of ledger that I have is going to be the same as the copy of ledger that you have so basically what log scene and what distributed ledger technology does is it creates a trust list network it creates a trustless network of nodes why after tog rafi that's how it does it and blocks in like you know as the name refers it it's nothing but a chain of blocks it's a cryptographically linked chain of blocks and each blocks contain nothing but a set of transactions that's what a blockchain is in like you know very simple layman terms and how do like you know how does all magic happens the magic happens where you like in so there's something called as a Byzantine general problem which is what blockchain tries to solve now I won't get into the technical details of what the Byzantines and your problem is but think of it like you know for example you have a fault that you need to attack and there are two armies one on this side of the fort and one on the other side of the fort and now there has to be some way for them to communicate and attack the food simultaneously however in order for them to communicate they need to send a messenger who needs to go via the food and like you know once the messenger goes via the food there is a chance that somebody can tamper the message and like you know but the two generals need to coordinate so how do they coordinate that's that's called the Byzantine general problem a blockchain solves that problem using something called as cryptography and like you know there are things like consensus algorithm which are technical but in layman's term I would define blockchain as a cryptographically linked list and like you know containing blocks and each block containing a list of transactions that what blockchain is we have seen lot of ups and downs in this blockchain technology it has been very volatile and we feel that it's still evolving for example like you know we have seen a very high rise in 2017 in number of the ICUs which was done and but like the success rate was very less and you know in 2018 the ICO the number of ICO generated has reduced the frequency has reduced nowadays so how do you see you know the blockchain is progressing day by day I will blockchain is not a disruptive technology it is a foundational technology so when you compare blockchain you probably would have to compare blockchain with something like the Internet now how does any foundational technology gets adopted so they are generally like you know four stages the first stage for any foundational technology is a killer application which in case of the internet was you know the email the second stage is like you know localized adoption the third stages setting of protocols and then the fourth stages destructive applications being build on that technology so when I compare like you know blockchain with Intel it I would say in Internet the killer app was probably the email and blockchain that killer up because split con right then like you know right now we're in the stage where we are having localized adoption of blockchain so like everybody is trying to experiment with blockchain they are not completely sure about locks in at the moment but we are in that stage where local concerns are being formed and locked in is being experimented there that's that's where blockchain is is right now but they are still like you know several stage of blocks in evolution to go even technically blocks in is not where it would probably be in the end it still still evolving okay so there are a lot of blockchain platforms for example aetherium yes dag my teaching I pledge it fabric what do you think are the top three trends in the current blockchain ecosystem um well so let's let's also define that right now we are where I like you know one most of the entire community call in blockchain 3.0 phase so what was blocked in one or two blocks in one or two was Bitcoin which was nothing but like you could just make transaction from one person to another in a crustless network of nodes that's what blockchain one but who was then came blockchain to dotto which was basically a theorem which gave you the abilities of having smart contracts now what a smart contracts smart contracts are nothing but like Hema if-then-else conditions that get attached to a particular transactions and get executed when that transaction happens so that that was blocked into dotto abut blocks in one dodo - dodo had a huge problem which was basically the problem of scalability where like you know you can do a lot of transactions on that particular block in fact the DPS or the transaction per second limit of Bitcoin was really small the same was with etherium you could probably do like you know 15 to 30 transactions per second on the etherium unlike with that sort of capability you can't really scale locked into a global level so now what we have is currently blocked in 3 don't know where everybody is working towards solving this particular problem the problem of scalability like how can we have millions of transactions in a second unblocked chain so that blockchain can actually be used for mass adoption and in the blockchain world we we have something called as a block chilled fill Emma which is so you have imagine a triangle and there are like 3 vertices of this triangle right so one is security the other is decentralization and the third is scalability and the blockchain 3 demo says that you can only get two out of the three so you either can get security and scalability and you have to compromise and decentralization or you can get decentralization scalability but then you have to compromise on security and like a so on and so forth currently the entire blockchain technical community is trying to find the sweet spot between those those three attributes and like you know achieve a blockchain or create a blockchain that would pretty much be able to like you know go towards mass adoption and along with that also have the security and decentralization ability that blockchain was there to be so how far is about seen technology from reaching its full potential well so let's again now take this in multiple dimensions the first dimension obviously is the technical dimension and there do I feel that it has not reach its full potential we are still in blockchain 3.1 I think this probably will be full auto fight or two until the scalability problem does not get solved I don't think blockchain would have reached its full technical potential so as to say oh now let's also talk about the adoption of blockchain blockchain is not that simple for normal user a normal user does know understand cryptography normal user does not understand what's a private key is what a public key is and how like you know to access there are cons in all of it so there's still quite some way to go there towards adoption as well and then now the legal stuff like you know we we have all heard how different governments have different take on cryptocurrency and blockchain and how those regulations are coming in trying to create some sort of an ecosystem or something sort of a legal structure for these stuff too like coexist with what is there I mean no government wants to leave its own fiat currency and suddenly start adopting cryptocurrency so there is some initial inertia there as well but the good thing is that regulations are being formed the government's are being cognizant of the fact that okay there is something called as cryptocurrency and they need to look into it so that to me is in itself a big recognition of blockchain technology per se and cryptocurrency as well then in terms of enterprise adoption I think blockchain is currently in a phase where enterprises are not sure most of them are currently sitting on the fence trying to see what others are doing some are doing P or C's some like you know still not into blocks and concretely they're very of the technology especially because of the I will say hostile but a little ambiguous legal framework and legal structure that is there so these these are currently like you know the challenges that the entire blocks in ecosystem faces but slowly I think we're going to reach probably the maximum potential in in a decade or so of itself so you feel that block chilling industry has real life use cases oh yes definitely the option industry has several real life use cases in the sense like you know forget bit connect Bitcoin is one real life use case which is the cryptocurrency use case but even besides that there are several industries that blockchain can impart there is obviously supply chain you know even the word supply chain in rock scene tells you that there is going to be some sort of a similarity between them on this healthcare stella gong the social network not be serious FinTech like you know frantic is an industry that is probably the most impacted by blockchain and that's what you hear about blockchain being compared to almost all the time but let's not talk about printing today I mean I would I would rather try to get into some other industries apart from faith because almost everybody has heard about how blocks and impacts will take across for it transactions and all of that mm-hmm then let us talk about healthcare I mean you know I think you are aware about the recent data leak in this biggest Singapore healthcare sector do you think blockchain can actually solve this problem and you know the major problem of healthcare industry that is interoperability and patient data management how do you think blockchain can be useful there well so they are still some of the stats that we have in the slides which tells us about the healthcare social media and telecom and like you know how many how much revenue has been raised in these sectors so looking at this figure yourself like when you can say that other industries you are going to get impacted with blockchain coming to healthcare you're absolutely right health care has several problems especially when it comes to interoperability especially when it comes to patient Rita management especially when it comes to like you know crypto attacks on patient data also what I mean by crypto doc is it confuses just sort of clarify although the data is encrypted in a crypto attack what happens is the data gets doubly encrypted and then like you know there is no way for you to retrieve that particular data so that's what a crypto darkest and you're absolutely right like you know blockchain can definitely help solve a lot of issues which are there with healthcare especially when it comes to not just patient data but also with clinical trial also with provenance even with fine provenance as like you know we discussed a while back blockchain is an immutable linked list it's an immutable ledger whatever happens in blockchain stays there forever nobody can change now we all know like you know about drug proven it's like you know the counterfeit drug issue it's very common especially in third world countries where almost a lot of people died because of counterfeit drugs and Oliver imagine if you could track the movement of drug how the drug was made Plus like you know where it was manufactured and how it got transferred to the port how it leads the wholesaler how at least the retailer all of it that you could track all of that on a blockchain in an immutable manner it would give a lot of transparency and it could solve a lot of issues that are there with luck provenance same with patient Nina management so currently you have several of these EHR systems which all have their own way of handling patient data and there is so if I go to hospital one and I get my reports down there there is no way for me to actually take that data and go to hospital - now with locks in you can do all of that so like you know with blocks and you can create a distributed storage system when all of your data is stored in a cryptographer manner and you can even share your data what I mean by charting is you can cut your data into several pieces have them stored in different areas so that like you know even if money against time for something happens your entire data is not leaked and then you can create an access or the permission layer on the blocks in itself where you as a patient can decide who will get to view the need and who will not get to the beautiful so basically the entire control of your data is in your is in your hand and at the same time like you know your data is secured its sharded and you ensure that there is no single point of failure so yes and like you know there are several other use cases as well even the funding mechanism making my healthcare we have all of these institution w-h-o and I can all Bill Gates Foundation Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation they they spend several billions of dollars in healthcare research and health care funding and where this fund goes is is a sort of mystery to a lot of people like you know sometimes the fund does not get utilized properly even the entire fund tracking can be done on blockchain so so yeah there are several new pieces in healthcare industry itself and I think apart besides FinTech and logistic healthcare is one of the hot sector which is really embracing blockchain technology okay and what are your thoughts and the Rhys Facebook data leaks even I'm scared to do activities on social media I mean you never know what's gonna happen so do you think that blockchain can actually make social media more secure and private well yes I mean obviously have you and heard about recently a leak and like you know Mark Zuckerberg testimony I mean that that became viral and the recent gdpr regulation itself says that now people are really conscious about how they did I stood who gets access to their data and privacy of data is now becoming a challenge so like you know this is this one of the things that came with it like Internet he was so many things but this is one of the bad things that probably happened blocking can definitely change all of that so now as as I mentioned earlier when we were discussing healthcare like you know your data can be in your control so blockchain can allow you to create a private world where you are realized and then it can allow you to control where exactly in with whom your data is going to be shared and besides all of that make you know it can allow you to make money from your data like it can allow you to monetize your data so currently all the stuff that you upload on Facebook on Instagram on what so that's not your property like you mom the moment you click that I accept terms and conditions that is the moment you give Facebook the control of all your data and then Facebook Google all of these big institutions they would use your data they would run their machine learning and algorithms and all of it and things and things data to marketers and in this entire process that the two parties that make money from all of this is Facebook Google are making these central institutions and the marketers but you as a consumer or as a user who is actually uploading or creating the reader does not make any money out of it that is one thing that blockchain can change blockchain can create an ecosystem where use you upload your data in your private world you dictate as to how much data you want to share with marketers you dictate as to how much money you want to make from your data and all of that is possible with blockchain is distributed storage and exists so yes I mean like you know I think social media is also one of the sectors that will slowly start adopting blockchain currently there are technical challenges I mean like you know Facebook probably handles billions of transactions per second and there is no blocked in system or no technology and technology in place at the moment that can probably handle the same amount of throughput so blockchain technology has to mature but once it matures and it will mature I think then blockchain would become really use case for social medias well you said that enterprises are still very very of using blockchain technology into their legacy systems do you feel that telecom is embracing this change and are they ready for the destruction well um telecom is definitely embracing the change in fact all the industries are experimenting with blocks in and they are currently building small PCs and like you know localized adoption of rock scene and then we cover several use cases like you know that blockchain can come into picture so again going back to our earlier discussion so Brockton has immutability but another thing that boxing has is thela reconciliation but you have your own ledger I have my own ledger and then using blockchain technology that ledger is automatically Talent so that's theta reconciliation right now that happens manually for example if you have to generate an invoice to me then I would need to tally your invoice I would need to check whether all of that that you have actually written voice is correct or not and then I would make you the payment I cannot trust that your advice is correct blockchain can change that so like blockchain will automatically have data reconciliation ability so that the invoice that you send to me is automatically compared and the data reconciliation happens why are the distributed ledger technology so the data reconciliation property of naksan is what I feel is going to be used tremendously in Telecom so we we all know the like you know right now data or mobile data is sort of electricity we can't live without it I mean you can't live without the internet it's almost as important as water electricity now it's one of the utility features that you but I'm sure you must have experienced no network in a lot of areas I mean especially in the buildings if you go to a mall if you go to the airport when the network is not that great but suppose you are provided a who doesn't have that great network in a particular area and I'm a subscriber of your particular network however there is another network and it will be which has great coverage in that particular area now how about if I create a Marketplace on blockchain where you network II can buy data capacity from network P so that your subscriber when it goes into a region will you don't have a great coverage area can automatically switch to network e can automatically consume it will piece data so the subscriber would have a great experience the entire data that the subscriber is consuming Y on it will be gets automatically reconciled fill your system using distributed ledger and the invoices are generated automatically and then like you know the entire transactions in the entire settlement happens from Kenickie in an automated manner on blockchain itself that's huge right that's amazing I mean that will create a marketplace where almost everybody wins I mean you when net work humans Network behavior subscribe weapons so that's that's one of the potentials of blockchain technology that I feel the telecoms of the telecom sector will really that's great and that means I do not have any well I would promise you that that you would have any call drops but definitely blockchain would ensure that the number of call rocks that you have now would reduce tremendously one serve this marketplace gets created and once you have once you once you have these different telecom operators and different network providers for Mac insertion and start using the blockchain technology per se to do their data reconciliation and make you forgive better services to user mm-hm okay and that was great uncle to understand about the industry insights on how we can use blockchain and I mean what I could understand is that doctrine is here to stay and it is going to the next destruction right oh well definitely it's a foundational technology but again um I would like to point out here that blockchain does not solve all your problems okay so Bloxom cannot fly an aeroplane I mean like you know people right now think that okay blockchain is a panacea no it's not so blockchain has the few properties immutability this is one of them data reconciliation is another of them creating crustless networks is the third so there are some very specific use cases where blockchain is really going to shine but that's that's pretty much it like it's not good or it's gonna not going to change everything it's not gonna make your card right but yes when as more and more parties as more and more people start adopting blockchain creating that network then people see a mass of T great thank you I'm good thank you so much for this webinar hey people I hope you enjoyed this webinar and got an insight about the different industries if you have any questions you can tie down your questions on the right-hand side corner and we have our corporate one pager you can see there in our handouts yeah thank you so much once again and stay tuned for more webinars on my site"}, {"id": "uM7OUTOi2Io", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM7OUTOi2Io", "title": "Blockchain Trends", "channel": "The Great IT Professional", "duration": "10:01", "views": 10, "published": "8 months ago", "transcript": " [Music] thank you so first of all welcome everybody and I am very glad that you made the time to attend this webinar it's not very long and we are focusing on looking at the important trends in blockchain technology so let's start the worth a reminder what is the blockchain so first of all let's think of a digital database with information and what important characteristics of being decentralized usually when we think database we are thinking of centralized entity blockchain in particular it has this characteristic of decentralized and in its initial design is open its public accessible to everybody the technology that is called blockchain technology is the technology that allows for creation of such a database and the first time when this was implemented is in the context of Bitcoin the digital currency Bitcoin that is developed on the Bitcoin blockchain if we think about other characteristics we are looking at a distributed ledger it's that decentralization where we want to think of a network of nodes equally important and this structure is allowing for transactions being done between two parties in a very efficient and verifiable way so it may change okay so let's start navigating and looking at what are important trades in blockchain technology the first one that we want to call out is blockchain as a service so by now there is enough development so that people don't have to implement from scratch all the components that are needed to come up with an application or with a blockchain or anything that has to do with this technology so in this big trend we have big companies renowned companies that already have enough structures enough development that people can use to do development in blockchain and we have here Microsoft Amazon Oracle and all these important names that are working to develop components that could be reused in blockchain technology and like anything else in this space the development is explosive and just to give you an example the other day I saw an announcement about neo block J n EO blockchain which is now integrated in the.net microsoft.net space and of course this is just the beginning but this is another example of this important trend when blockchain is becoming more and more like a offering us a service the other big trend is Federation initial thought when we were looking at blockchain developments was along the lines that blockchain is public it's transparent is open to everybody at the same time after recognizing the importance and the breakthrough type of innovation that blockchain technology is more and more companies that are developing their own blockchain which is this other aspect the private blockchain and of course that in this development it was recognized the utility of having federated block chains which means that a part of the blockchain is private controlled seen by only approved parties and the other part would be open think of a company opening parts of the blockchain for customers so this would be an example of Federation this concept the federated blockchain also is called consortium and here we have three types of consortium approaches one is more along the lines of technology focused the other is business focus and the third is dual focus it has all these components and here in the bullet we have a few examples the third important trend in blockchain technology is stable coins let's first talk a little bit about what exactly we are talking about when we mentioned stable coins we probably are familiar with the big changes in price when we think cryptocurrencies and we probably remember how Bitcoin reached almost 20,000 US dollars and then went back to $3,000 $4,000 so there is a lot of volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin is just an example we have many other examples for the exchange the monetary exchange to be viable and to make business sense this volatility is in an impediment so a recent relatively recent development in this space is the concept of stable coins and examples are for instance I'm looking at the second bullet in this page USD coin that is launched by coin based going base is an exchange where you can exchange fiat with the cryptocurrency and the concept is that they created hi there I hope you enjoyed that

Trends and Challenges", "channel": "Bernard Marr", "duration": "26:00", "views": 1649, "published": "6 months ago", "transcript": " in this video I want to talk about blockchain and some of the latest blockchain trends and challenges and I'm very pleased to say that I'm here with Martha Bennet your VP and principal analyst at Forrester and you have spent quite a bit of time researching blockchain and maybe we can explore what you see as some of the trends which you see as some other challenges around blockchain and maybe we can start exploring what what blockchain actually is you start with a question that can't be answered and as to your point quite a bit of time yes you're right on that and that I first picked up on blockchain from an enterprise perspective in late 2014 which really was the very very early days I've been deeply into it ever since and that's why I'm also one of those people who say what it is yes you can come up with a high level definition around it's an architectural principle first of all it's not a thing there's not one thing z-bo changes an architectural principle around shared data that can be trusted and when we say shared we mean shared across organizational and in many cases national boundaries and it's also an architectural principle without going into the technology side of it which we could that can support this construct called smart contracts which is a wonderful misnomer because these things are neither smart nor contracts in the legal sense but what they do support is the automation of business processes across corporate boundaries again focused on that principle of shared and trusted data I know that's a little bit convoluted and maybe not what you're expecting but that's what I distill it down into when we look at what could this actually do for us yeah and I completely agree I think the potential is huge at the moment when people say blockchain they think quite often this one blockchain there know lots of different blockchains I think the construct was initially developed as the basis for Bitcoin but what do you see what different block chains do you see and how do they differ well the first thing I'd say when I look at the overall architectural principle of not talking in tech times a little of an append-only structure where you use cryptographic principles such as one way hashes PKI base signatures the distributed replicated nature the first instance of one of those beasts I actually found as part of my research was back in 94 ok so from a principles perspective it's not necessarily new what changed everything of course was Bitcoin yeah and that's why also a lot of the time you get that association between Bitcoin and equals blockchain which is not the case and in enterprise most people understand that these days but I still find that whenever something particularly dramatic happens in the cryptocurrency Wild West or universe whatever you want to call it I actually get an uptick in client interest on blockchain from an enterprise perspective as well so people still have trouble separating the two and that's also why I'll just throw in another term distributed ledger technology again if we wanted to be really pedantic about it a blockchain is a distributed ledger but a distributed ledger doesn't have to be a blockchain but it doesn't get us anywhere because people use the terms interchangeably and in fact in particular in banking there is a distinct preference for the term DLT because it puts a clear distance to the cryptocurrency side and and what you can do in enterprise yeah the way I sometimes explain blockchain is that literally it's just a way of storing data in a distributed network so where you don't have them one parties with which which is which is one aspect of it and the word that I've actually avoided is decentralized and do you have as well yeah because you still have some centralized aspects to it whether you like it or not but close you know just let's just think in terms of enterprise now not public blockchains where anyone can play when you're looking at an enterprise environment you still need to make sure that the network's actually up and running that the principles that were agreed in a it for the shared environment that everybody who is part of that environment actually performed those and behaves as intended and somebody has to have the right to take action if say some a node goes rogue or indeed I'm getting offered a little bit of a tangent here but that also requires essential element let's say a smart contract goes rogue does interacts with another smart contract in a strange way or receives an input that was unexpected and suddenly starts paying out money left right and center or whatever it may be or doing really weird things you need a kill switch just of the sort that was introduced after the flash crash in trading and for that you need some form of central body so that whole miss it is a Miss that these things kind of run themselves but I've actually evaded your question as to what I see going on in that but actually when it comes to the different types of blockchain frameworks that are out there I'm probably now up to sixty six zero each of which promised to solve all those niggly things that the others haven't solved because we still have trade offs if you look at the original and public block chains Bitcoin and aetherium they have serious throughput limits that you simply cannot overcome unless you apply other constructs which introduce their own downsides so when I look at the and I'm actually pretty do you want me to name a few names yes yeah the environments that I currently see as the one of that most that enterprises are really interested in and are actually working with and in and I'm and there are networks that have gone beyond pilot project what I'm seeing there not surprisingly hyper ledger fabric cerium but permission to serum or quorum which as you know is the JPMorgan Fork of quorum which has just been in the news about possibly being spun out to consensus whatever so never a dull moment then of course there's our three Carter as well which strictly speaking isn't a blockchain but please it is part of that whole category because it is a distributed system where certain principles are being applied to address not just the throughput issues but one of the biggest challenges block chains are meant for data sharing but we need to preserve confidentiality both for personal privacy and commercial reasons now that doesn't mean we should try and replicate every single copy that the SEC that same process that we're doing to we're tying ourselves into complete knots with them so it's more going back to basics well we can come back to that point let me go back to the platforms and and environments that I'm seeing so our three kadhai is particularly unpopular in financial services also in insurance I'm also seeing quite a lot of multi-chain around in deployed environments hyper ledger Sawtooth has been gaining quite a bit of traction and then there are also some very interesting environments like Kadena hmm which to be fair we'll have to see yet where that goes but the that combination of being able to support both the public and the private part to a blockchain that is quite interesting and this for me is one of the key takeaways I think that actually there isn't one blockchain there are lots of different technologies they all have pros and cons and as an organization saying I'm using blockchain you can't really do that you need to figure out what you want to use it for and then what the right technology is well and that's exactly it the so and I was asked by a well-known publication a year or so ago what's the percentage of blockchain projects that you see failing and I said 95% plus and that is because in that huge euphoria whatever's the problem the solution is blockchain you know some banks were running dozens and dozens of projects and I don't know whether they were expecting miracles or whatever but not surprisingly when you start in such an unfocused way you're not going to go places so the first piece all like what any technology dare I say what are you trying to do absolutely and then was blockchain and again this is not unique to blockchain there are two aspects to it one is where does the Shu hurt in particular going back to my earlier comment about multi-party there are so many process involving multiple parties where there is huge cost in reconciling data if you can use a blockchain based network to remove friction that's a huge benefit is not revolutionizing anything no but it it confers huge benefit then you look at the other side an almost said coin but there was an unintentional pun because that's when you're looking at the opportunity to do business differently and let me just give you one real example tokenization and I'm not talking about cryptocurrency token see anything yes tokens can represent whatever you want them to represent digital assets but in this case I'm talking about other asset assets as well that could be physical assets for example a tokenized vehicle or apartment gives you completely different opportunities for for lending because you can fractionalize a token and you can track what is happening to it you can apply rules to how it can be traded there are lots of stuff and indeed when you look at some of the use cases that what you need to start with something sensible that people can relate to start small but think big an example would be and that's quite a few networks around that use case invoice factoring you know when the company gets an invoice what won't get paid for 90 days needs money today takes it to a bank says can you extend a loan against the invoice not surprisingly that's full a food first people go and either either the invoice itself is fraud you want to start with or you shop it to different banks and of course the banks want to avoid that bank B wants to know whether Bank a has already expended alone against the invoices data sharing in that kind of environment depending on jurisdiction can actually be quite tricky because you're not allowed to share certain data that's meant to be confidential by tokenizing an invoice you can create a unique ID for it that doesn't need to divulge the confidential details but which can be used by another bank to check whether that invoice has already been went against interesting very valuable use case that can deliver benefit today but once I've got that invoice as a token I can start thinking differently the banks aren't doing it today yet it's it's one step too far but it's it's part of building that future for doing things differently so what what are some of the the most interesting use cases I fear that a year ago there were millions of use cases people were so excited about blockchain now this has died down a little bit the hype has gone away but I feel that companies are experimenting with more serious use cases so what are some of them the most interesting ones are the ones that have the biggest potential that that you you see out there the ones that have the biggest potential will are also going to be the ones that probably take the longest and some may actually not come to pass simply because it's very very complex to do not just change the wait processes work but you need to have regulatory changes and so on but where I so let me just go one step back as well a lot of the use cases we see out there today in particular around supply chain track and trace they don't actually need a blockchain but interestingly enough many of them wouldn't even have got off the ground without a blockchain so I can actually see a bifurcation in that I can see that where some use cases will actually revert back to almost leveraging a centralized utility where the data store itself may be centrally controlled because distributed data stores on they always have an overhead and they're complex huge energy and of course there aren't data stores coming along that can be administered in the central manner but which have the characteristics of a blockchain based environment in the sense that they're append-only they use cryptographic techniques and so on so that's some very interesting stuff going on and there's also some intro there are some interesting developments and there's one company I didn't mention that used to be part of that topped here where the you could see really important projects of course digital asset because they had one of the very very first and that's also strictly speaking not a blockchain they had one of the very first actual corporate commitment to this new technology they have pivoted and quite sensibly decided that there is no point in competing with the framework guys they're developing a full framework because there's too much out there already but they have a unique asset in the digital in the digital asset markup language which is a smart contract modeling language in which it's actually quite difficult to do things wrong so you could actually foresee environments whereby this data store is centralized but you're still using multi-party smart contracts on top of that data store that is the most strategic and I've not seen anybody actually do it but the strategic thinkers are actually noodling in that direction so actually when I say bifurcation it would be a trifurcation one would be environments where you actually go back to utility model but now that you trust each other in that kind of environment you're not so bothered about the blockchain specifics anymore in particular as more and more companies also realize that some of the features or characteristics that are being ascribed to blockchain on not in fact intrinsic to blockchain nothing is immutable so once and that you still need you still need backups you still need operational management you need oh you need to have extra processes in place when a node goes down and gets brought back up so actually yeah let's revert to traditional technologies those for some of the use cases others I could see more in the direction that I just mentioned where you have multi-party smart contracts but against a centrally administered data store here and the third one is where people are really starting to turn processes on their head and like for example even in today's environment because again a little bit of background there one of the reasons a lot of blockchain projects don't develop the way people are hoping is because of that lack of understanding that it's about an ecosystem yes somebody needs to start the initiative but then it's all about bringing your ecosystem on board there's got to be something in it for everybody hmm whether that whether there is somebody that might be disintermediated well they will throw roadblocks in your way if they don't see a future for themselves in their son way unless you can find a way of really pushing out an intermediary a lot of the time that's simply not possible because you would damage your business so that's one part the other one is the imbalance in size of companies you have a huge retailer and you have somebody who grow strawberries mmm clearly they are not equal but unless there is something in it for that strawberry producer and you can make it such so for example if if you tell that strawberry producer the reason we want you to use that app and actually input your data truthfully and faithfully and every time if there is a recall we will know immediately whether you're affected or not and we will continue buying your strawberries if it wasn't you and if it was you then at least you can take immediate action and I simplify aggressive awesome but in a more sophisticated example and that's in Canada and it is it is public knowledge is another huge retailer that's got again it looks like a classic logistics track and trace kind of environment but what they do with it so the smart contract has within it the contract conditions for the delivery if that delivery is signed off at the store as complete in full whatever the proper term is the smart contract will go back into the system of the retailer and trigger the invoice unless there's an exception what that means for the logistics company even if the payment times are 60 days the logistics company will know that within 60 days X amount is going to be paid that is worth something absolutely logistics company and that's what I mean about there's got to be something in it for everybody and it's that failing that often derails projects but what I hope I've just Illustrated that in its own way is actually quite revolutionary as well having a smart contract trigger an invoice inside of a retailer systems without manual intervention good that requires trust and the willingness to do things differently the final thing I'd like to talk about is Facebook's attempt to create a cryptocurrency they they they they're that they're hoping to launch Libra what are you views on that I'm still traffic I'm quite honestly trying to figure out what Facebook really wanted to do with that because when you look at how Libra is constructed and quite honestly it's still not entirely clear how it is constructed because while they've published a list of currencies that are in this and I call it a so-called stable coin because that's another one of those meaningless terms you've got a basket of currencies in there as well as other high-quality liquid assets whatever that means so how and and that is so is it actually a money market fund that under there is a security it really depends on how it's made up but from the from a governance perspective because Libra of course is many different things it's the Libra blockchain it's the Libra token and in fact there were two of those but we didn't don't need to go down that rathole what makes it very made it completely contradictory for me to comprehend is that huge message around banking the unbanked for two reasons number one one of the biggest issues around banking the unbanked is kyc and AML meaning know your customer regulations it is extremely costly to conclusively establish the identity of somebody who may have have no fixed address for example no fixed employment and I know this we know you do a lot of work with the banks you will know how expensive it is for banks to do kyc now to do kyc on people who are outside of the existing banking system the other issue is that outside of the exists people outside of the existing banking systems are often outside of it because they don't have enough money to make it worthwhile if we suspend disbelief for one moment and say that smartphones are now so prevalent that even even those people have moved on from a future for into a smartphone because people very often have a smartphone when they you know in countries where even for very for people without much money at all the phone is actually absolute the payment instrument let's just say the phone is there but in order to get Libra you still need to engage with an exchange in order to exchange your national currency into Libra unless it becomes their own payment making yeah but then you have then you already need a whole ecosystem which starts replacing a country's currency which is one of the destabilizing effects that regulators are concerned about but I'm just purely looking at it from a cost perspective because Libra coins according to the original proposal can only be purchased by special entities whether those special entities are the same as exchanges or whether there is another step is possibly a little nebulous still and then you need to buy it from the exchange so somebody somewhere there is there's inconvenience and and fees involved even if you manage to hide those to some degree or get subsidies but then it's also back to what problem are you actually solving because it's it's usually when people want to use a currency other than the one of the country in which they live is because they need to go cross-border or because they want to evade existing payment systems having stated loudly that Libra will be conformant with all regulations then it becomes cross-border unless it's back to the replacements are we're going around in circles what I would say though is that from a technical perspective I find Libra are very interesting because when you we go back to our more general blockchain discussion and while I would say that block chains are 80% business and only 20 percent technology there is plenty to be solved still and many I mentioned amel and said you know it's actually quite difficult to do things wrong with that that also makes it a bit more restrictive the downside is that many of the Soraa in fact all of the so-called turing-complete environments can also be subverted and actually become attack vectors the first time I've seen the designer of a new language actually take the compiler into consideration as an attack vector is the Libra team with the move language so they've really thought about all the things that don't work so well in existing block chains and their scripting it's not contract scripting languages so there is there is interesting stuff going on there and you probably didn't want to go down that day probably I could carry on no four days probably good good good point two to finish this conversation I I think what we're saying is blockchain there isn't one blockchain there lots of different technologies there's no agreement on any standards yet so businesses have to be very careful what block chains to experiment with there are definitely lots of use cases but not blockchain for the sake of it I think there are lots of other technologies you can use to address similar business challenges right and some fascinating use cases in the pipeline Facebook's Libre is one of them we have to wait and see right all right I would say we are there is definitely are there there it's important that people don't expect too much and don't expect the technology to do it for them be cognizant of the fact that that technology is developing at a tremendous pace and that's why I came up with that and I'm not the only one that's analogy between the early Nokia feature phones very shiny and now we look at those and we laugh but we didn't know that smartphones were gonna be appearing within 10 years or so what we want is a smart phone where we are as they feature phone hmm so there's real potential oh absolutely and I said there's a tremendous amount of innovation going on and they're not somebody asks me where what will it look like in five years time I'll say I have no idea the only thing I can say it won't look like what it looks like today very good thank you very much Martha"}, {"id":

"13:01", "views": 156111, "published": "1 year ago", "transcript": " what are the seven biggest technology trends for 2020 that you have to be ready for right now hi I'm Bernard MA and in this video I want to look at the key technology trends as a business and technology futurist I get asked this question all the time what are the biggest trends businesses and and people in those businesses need to get getting ready for and I am currently writing a new book on all the big long-term technology trends that will come out next year but what I do every year is to look ahead just one year and say ok what is going to happen next year what's going to happen in 2020 so let's look at the 7 biggest trends for this year the first trend is artificial intelligence as a service in lots of my videos I talked about artificial intelligence and machine learning and how it is completely transforming our world what I see is and i-i've just as you might have seen my most recent book artificial intelligence and practice where look at how 50 companies are now using AI and machine learning in practice of what we're seeing as companies are starting to apply this technology and is starting to change our businesses however what I see is that lots of businesses still see developing their own AI infrastructure as a really expensive proposition so what is happening now is that more and more organizations use AI as a service this basically means I can now go to companies like Google like Amazon like Microsoft and simply say I would like to apply artificial intelligence to my processors I've got some data that I can use to train my machine learning algorithms and they can then supply the algorithms they can supply the infrastructure and you simply pay as a service and this is a massive trend and one that is going to get bigger into 20 so for me the first trend artificial intelligence in general will make a big impact on businesses we will get used to working alongside a is but in particular the as a service offering will make a really really big difference to companies Trent number two is 5g this basically is the fifth generation of mobile networks so this means you've probably seen the evolution from 3G to 4G basically has given us fast connectivity on our mobile phones on 4G you can now easily watch videos what 5g will do is it will accelerate this it will give us speeds that are very similar to what we have in terms of high-speed Internet connections into our homes and into our businesses it will reduce the latency so everything would be a lot faster and it would make those connections more reliable this has huge implications not only that we will have mobile phones that our 5g enabled that can we can easily stream music and videos but for business especially connecting machinery for self-driving cars all of this these devices all these Internet of Things smart devices need reliable fast connectivity to push data forwards and backwards from the cloud and this is going to and 5g is going to make a massive difference with all of this what we are currently seeing is that this is starting to be rolled out so we see this in inner cities of major capitals we see this in confined areas but in 2020 we will see much wider coverage and we will see costs of 5g connectivity going down so we will have not only better connected Mobile's less relied will become much less reliant on on fiber connections into our houses and into our homes and we can simply use the 5g network have amazingly fast and reliable internet connectivity everywhere and be able to transfer data everywhere and so what what I do as a business futurist is I help businesses understand what this means and and 5g is one area that we're looking at very intensively with lots of businesses helping them to understand what this means for offering completely news product and services improving their internal processes connecting machines and things like predictive maintenance so 5g is another massive trend the third trend to look at is autonomous driving again this is a trend I have spoken about a lot lots of my videos talk about the the future of Transport and autonomous driving Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla has basically said that by the end of 2019 he will have his cars the Tesla's will be completely autonomous and hopefully we'll see by 2020 that those cars will be on the road being able to drive anywhere completely autonomously currently we still we're still seeing lots of issues around regulation lots of issues around infrastructure but if 5g comes along we won't have those infrastructure issues anymore and I can see self-driving cars everywhere when I talk about autonomous driving it's not just completely self-driving cars as also that we've seen evolution towards that so steps and steps taken for example we now have cars that have lane assistance so they will watch where you're driving and they're help you to switch lanes and cars that will brake automatically and detect hazards so this is going to happen more and more again it's not just cars we now have self-driving ships cell flying drones and robot delivery so where I live in Milton Keynes we have the starship robots that now deliver my Amazon parcels they deliver my my local shopping so we will see more autonomous driving as a massive trend in 2020 my fourth trend for 2020 is predictive and precision medicine we are currently seeing is this complete transformation of healthcare and medicine where technology is making a really big difference so recent advances in Internet of Things technology so smarter devices in addition to artificial intelligence and some real breakthroughs in genomics mean that we can now have much more much more predictive capabilities just think about things like the the Apple watch now has recently been an article that the Apple watch could potentially extend someone's life by two years because it can monitor your heart conditions it can give you warnings and this is going to happen more and more that we will have more smart devices helping to monitor us and we will have the development in genomics that helped us to target treatments specifically to you so the healthcare system doctors will be able to detect what your genetic makeup is and then they can find treatments that will work best for you deliver the best outcomes for you as an individual and we see massive advances so again if he I've recently written about some of the latest trends and medicine in healthcare so he can explore this further on my website my fifth trend for 2020 is computer vision again this has been on my radar for for a number of years but we are seeing real acceleration in this at the moment where we now have amazing capabilities of machines that are able to recognize what is on a photograph they can now recognize things in video footage and obviously we have face recognition capability which is making a big impact we now have devices like the latest iPhones that use face ID so basically a face recognition of face scan to allow you to lock on in terms of security but we'll see massively new advances we've seen this recently in in companies that operate in China some some taxi operators or Diddy the competitor to uber in China then are using face recognition technology in the vehicle to recognize drivers and for both security purposes and billing purposes we've seen this and in Amazon's trials stores where they use face recognition technology to monitor what you who you are and then what you're buying so you they want the cameras will watch what you're putting into your shopping bags and you simply walk out and the system will charge you appropriately so this is technology that will evolve very fast in 2020 and is something every company needs to watch out for my sixth trend for 2020 is extended reality I've recently done a few videos on this on subscribe to the channel if you never want to miss any of these or had head to my website where I have a complete section on extended reality basically what we're seeing is three different types we see virtual reality where we completely immerse ourselves into into the digital world using headsets or we have augmented reality will be overlay things onto the real world using computer screens or glasses and we have mixed reality will be overlaid digital object into the the real world like a hologram and we are able to interact with this and what we've recently seen is that technology is evolving so fast in this space so Microsoft has just released their latest hololens a mixed reality headset that is probably leading-edge we're seeing augmented reality being used by companies to try things out I've recently done a few videos on this talking about how companies like Rolex are now using this technology to allow you to use your your phone screen to basically try out Rolex watches using augmented reality that is how this whole idea of try before you buy will make a big impact and will definitely go mainstream in 2020 and my last my seventh trend for 2020 is blockchain technology in the news we hear a lot about Bitcoin and its price going up and down when I talk about blockchain I don't necessarily necessarily talk about the Bitcoin cryptocurrency I talk about the business applications of blockchain and lots of those are probably not traditional block chains they're more I call distributed Ledger's so they're not completely distributed but they're run by a number of companies so we have the benefits of blockchain technology but not necessarily some of the downsides and what we've seen in in in this year is that companies like FedEx and companies like Walmart and MasterCard are heavily investing into blockchain technology and then of course in 2020 we will see the launch of Facebook's Libre cryptocurrency coin again a collaboration with other organizations like uber and Spotify that will all be part of this so we will see blockchain technology as a major technology trend and again on my web site you can find tons of articles explaining all the background on blockchain on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies if you're interested in this or browse my channel we have lots of examples on this too so those are my seven trends hopefully they're useful I believe very much that every business and every individual really needs to get to grips with these seven trends to be ready for 2020"}]
