That was perhaps most evident in areas like sourcing personal protective equipment (PPE), a critical component of infection control strategies in healthcare settings. In most cases, domestic supply chains weren\u2019t able to scale to meet domestic needs, and the sudden increase in demand also showed international suppliers weren\u2019t always as reliable as might be expected.\n\nShortages can be caused by production line stoppages and supply chain inefficiencies due to a lack of insight. The health crisis illuminated something we already knew: insights based on IoT data have a key role in ensuring supply chain activities are anchored on trusted insights driving efficiency and responsiveness in times of crisis.\n\nBut while it seems an irrefutable fact that logistics companies should deploy IoT technology as fast as possible, those deployments must be carefully managed. Just before the pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) Business Index 2020, a survey and report launched by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), reported that 28 percent of executives believed supply chain management and logistics benefited more from IoT enhancements than any other part of their business. We expect this percentage will rise, as the current projections for the global logistics market indicate growth of approximately 18 percent by 2021. The industry is already at the forefront of meeting the growing demand for PPE and finding innovative ways to distribute the supply of other essential commodities by using IoT.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the EIU report showed that the industrial sector was also benefiting from early IoT adoption, and currently, it is well-positioned to help meet consumer demand. Although global economic activity has decreased, the deployment of IoT-empowered automation technologies is increasing: Nearly half of the business leaders are accelerating plans to automate their businesses.\n\nAs the global business community grapples with questions over how to avoid supply chain bottlenecks, it\u2019s worth examining some of the IoT-empowered tools companies are using to adopt new technologies and platforms and how these businesses are using precise and reliable data to build integrity across supply chains.\n\nShortening of the Supply Chain\n\nSupply chains are dizzyingly complex and fragmented. All points along the chain require tremendous data management efforts \u2014 from fielding customer demand and working with raw material suppliers to producing components, order requests, and management and delivery service.\n\nBefore COVID-19, IoT brought together many parts of the supply chain to create a single product. For example, the world\u2019s largest passenger airliner, the Airbus A380, contains 4 million parts produced by 1,500 companies from 30 countries. If there is a problem with the supply chain for just one of these parts, the creation of an entire fleet of airliners can be held up.\n\nAs the economy shifts toward more local production and distribution markets, the solution to fragmentation will need to lean toward creating simpler, more transparent supply chains rather than simply decreasing the number of parts per product.\n\nPhil Skipper, head of business development at global IoT leader Vodafone Business believes that shortening the supply chain could allow smaller companies to bring their products to market faster. In contrast, larger enterprises will need to focus more on security and scale to manage countless streams of digital data to get real business outcomes. A shorter supply chain, says Skipper, allows companies to \u201crestructure [their] process, but it also gives more control to execute [their plans] faster and more consistently.\u201d\n\nSmart Labels Mitigate Supply Chain Challenges\n\nEven as more production goes local, global trade is necessary. Yet all too often, kinks along the supply chain prevent products from ever reaching markets.\n\nGlobally, billions of dollars worth of pharmaceutical products are shipped at improper temperatures. In contrast, other products either don\u2019t arrive at their destinations until their use-by dates have expired or are not as-promised by suppliers. These problems aren\u2019t just expensive for companies \u2014 they can be life-threatening for people reliant on the drugs.\n\nSmart labels look just like normal adhesive postal labels. Still, their iSIM technology, consisting of a SIM, battery, antenna, microprocessor, and modem all integrated into a single chip, is specifically designed for low-power IoT devices. These smart labels connect via public mobile networks and provide continuous service from its power source. They allow companies to monitor products in real-time through the supply chain and take action when there is a problem. If, for example, a sudden change in temperature occurs, a notification is sent that triggers an alert to take corrective action or highlight an area for process improvement. Also, the smart labels can\u2019t be removed from products without inhibiting their functionality, making them more tamper-proof, thereby ensuring the legitimacy of shipments.\n\nAutomation and Robotics Help Meet Customer Demand\n\nIn addition to creating \u2018smart\u2019 products that use data to alert companies to real-time problems in the supply chain, declining revenues due to the coronavirus crisis are forcing companies to accelerate investments in automation and robotics.\n\nEven before the onset of the current pandemic, robots were already used to speed up production in warehouses operated by major companies. Amid the health crisis, venture capitalists have fueled this growth by injecting $36 million into AI firm Brain Corp. to increase automation in areas of the logistics industry that are struggling to meet consumer demand and handle human labor shortages. As more companies lean into automation, we can expect safer, more resilient supply chains.\n\nChange Won\u2019t Happen Overnight\n\nFor some years now, businesses have been looking at gaining a competitive advantage on process optimization, greater automation, and better use of data \u2014 collectively known as digital transformation. COVID-19 is simply accelerating these plans.\n\nAmid the health crisis, we can expect more companies to meet global market demands while focusing on digital transformation to function in the new economic world order."}, {"title": "How FoodMaven impacted the pandemic food supply chain by reducing food waste - an Acumatica use case", "link": "https://diginomica.com/how-foodmaven-impacted-pandemic-food-supply-chain-reducing-food-waste-acumatica-use-case", "date": "2020-12-04 10:54:59-08:00", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "['business', 'food', 'foodmaven', 'lems', 'whats', 'impacted', 'reducing', 'acumatica', 'data', 'thats', 'pandemic', 'community', 'supply', 'waste', 'going', 'chain', 'case']", "summary": "But could FoodMaven rise to the pandemic food supply challenge?\nBuilding a new marketplace for selling food supplyWe would all love to stop food waste in landfills.\nLems outlined three major reasons: food oversupply, imperfect-but-still-perfectly consumable food, and local food.\nFoodMaven actually began with a pilot project on Acumatica, related to community purchasing of food at the Pikes Peak Community College food bank.\nWhat's going on every day?", "text": "(Feature image via FoodMaven web site)\n\nPandemic life has exposed food uncertainty to more people than ever before - including our dependence on international supply chain networks beyond local control. In turn, that's fueled interest in localizing resources - and supporting organizations that serve populations in need.\n\nEnter the Denver-based FoodMaven. FoodMaven's goal? No more landfills of discarded food. Recover the $200 billion in lost revenue caused by wasted food each year - and give buyers and suppliers a new marketplace to sell and purchase food - before it hits the landfill.\n\nBut could FoodMaven rise to the pandemic food supply challenge? On a recent video call, Greg Lems, FoodMaven's Director of Engineering, gave me the full story.\n\nBuilding a new marketplace for selling food supply\n\nWe would all love to stop food waste in landfills. Much of the discarded food is perfectly good for human consumption. But - easier said than done. So why does food waste happen? Lems outlined three major reasons: food oversupply, imperfect-but-still-perfectly consumable food, and local food. Local? Yes, because some farmers are too small to be considered by the \"big food system.\" Can a marketplace help? Perhaps, but you better get the tech right. As Lems told me:\n\nIn order to create a marketplace for that type of product, you have to have some technology behind it. It's more than just \"Hey, let's create an app or a website.\" It's creating a fair amount of smarts around that entire chain. We have suppliers that come to us and say, \"Hey, we have over-supply food, how do we get that with you, and then get it into a marketplace?\"\n\nFoodMaven also needs the tech to reach out to restaurants and other organizations that buy food in bulk, and to do that at scale. Then there is the pricing engine. Lems:\n\nPart of our value proposition is that the food we sell, we can sell it at a discount, because it was, you know, sort of rescued. But if we don't have the prices right, nobody's going to want to buy it. So we have to be able to create algorithms, and store a tremendous amount of data about correct prices for food.\n\nWelcome to the engineer's riddle. Each piece of FoodMaven's process requires a technical underpinning - far more than their previous QuickBooks system could handle. That's why Lems joined the organization in July 2018.\n\nGetting the food sourced properly, putting it into a marketplace, and then having the right pricing around it - every piece of that has a technology component... I have a career as a software developer and technology leader; it just seemed like a super cool problem to try to solve.\n\nWhen Lems started, the tech was still adhoc:\n\nIn the beginning, startups are, from a technology standpoint - they're all spreadsheets. That's how you manage your business as a startup. Then you take the credit card out, and buy [your first] SaaS solution. That's where we were when I joined.\n\nYour tech platform must support your growth\n\nLems wanted an infrastructure that could grow with their ambitions:\n\nPart of our strategy is to start in one part of the country, in this case, Colorado, and then acquire food distributors in other markets across the United States... I just went to Dallas to get our acquisition down there cut over to our new platform.\n\nTime to think like an enterprise:\n\nAs you look at a rollout like that, how are you going to go to multiple cities, multiple markets, integrate with e-commerce systems, integrate with a warehouse management system, all that kind of stuff? Obviously, you have to look at a more enterprise-type solution. And that's what I was brought on to do.\n\nSo was Acumatica on the radar screen from the beginning? Lems explains:\n\nYes, we had a few different vendors on the radar screen - Infor was in there, as well as NetSuite. But we really liked Acumatica for its flexibility and integration capabilities.\n\nPulling in data across systems was a key criteria:\n\nWe have a lot of things we want to tie into. Like I mentioned before, data and data flow is important. We need to be able to integrate to a number of other systems... That's what we liked about Acumatica was its flexibility - and also its ability to grow and scale.\n\nFoodMaven actually began with a pilot project on Acumatica, related to community purchasing of food at the Pikes Peak Community College food bank. FoodMaven used Acumatica to manage the food inventory. That project showed Lems what he needed to see:\n\nWe said, \"Let's have an initial project with it; that way, we can see how the integration works before we do a full-on cutover. \"Anybody who's done ERP rollouts knows all sorts of horror stories of trying to do too many things at once. So we figured we'd give it a whirl this way - and it went well.\n\nFoodMaven's main Colorado business went live on Acumatica in September of 2019; they were fully operational on Acumatica well before the proverbial adversity hit the fan this spring. So what happened next?\n\nFortunately, cloud ERP enables remote working. But as Lems says, some things you do have to do in person, even when you're running on cloud tech. Example: putting stickers on warehouse boxes, inventory counts, scanner guns. He picks up the story:\n\nUnless you have a warehouse full of robots, which, like most startups, we don't, everything hit the fan... For one, as you alluded to, a lot of employees needed to be able to work from home. Acumatica, as a cloud solution, is great for that. We didn't have to get everybody on a VPN, and go through all that hassle.\n\nThe pandemic hits the fan\n\nFoodMaven's customer demand went in different directions. Restaurants shut down; retailers found their shelves bare - and needed FoodMaven more than ever. Colleges were emptied - one client source (temporarily) gone. But: hospital demand remained steady. FoodMaven was compelled to add another service: business-to-consumer sales. As Lems tells it, B2C was less of a business imperative, and more of a community obligation.\n\nWe had a number of members of our community interested in our product... That's somebody coming to you and saying, \"Here's my credit card; I want to buy some food.\" We felt the community deserved that common offering. And: it furthered our mission to try to prevent that food from going to waste. So we set it up. We still have a limited presence of a B2C, which is supported by Acumatica on the back end, so that people in our community can make purchases from us. Anybody who wants to buy fifty pounds of chicken breasts, have at it - just make sure you have a big freezer.\n\nAll in all, FoodMaven pulled through. If anything, the public interest in a sustainable food supply has gone up. I don't believe in making \"silver lining\" observations about what we've been through this year, but there was already a growing interest in local/organic food. Public interest in the food supply chain is at an all-time high. If that's a permanent pandemic effect, we'll take it. Lems:\n\nIt's something that hits home with everybody. You know, with everything that's been going on in politics recently, somebody said, \"You can watch what's happening at the national level on TV, but really, what it comes down to is: what's your mayor doing? And what's your school board doing?\" Those are the things that affect you the most. So it makes sense that people are paying attention to local - and food as part of that.\n\nAs FoodMaven presses on, what else do they want to do with Acumatica? Lems says their recent focus was customizations needed for the food industry. Now he wants to push ahead with even deeper e-commerce and warehouse management integrations. Keeping up with Acumatica's new functionality keeps Lems' team busy also:\n\nAcumatica is always coming out with new features. We've been through one major upgrade at this point, and it was great. There were a lot of really interesting things - integrations with reporting platforms, and data and analytics, which we want to dive more into as well. So we're really excited about what's kind of next.\n\nThe wrap - taking on the data and analytics challenge\n\nWe talked about where Lems wants to take FoodMaven with analytics. As DataMaven adds more metropolitan areas, more data will be pulled into Acumatica - including pricing preferences, and seasonal demand fluctuations. Lems sees all of that going into Acumatica's built-in dashboards. That provides views for the operations team, as they manage the flow of products from FoodMaven warehouses.\n\nLems' team has customized their share of Acumatica reports. That's because FoodMaven has reporting needs - beyond the typical business metrics like margin analysis. Some of their supply comes in on consignment. When that food is sold, consignment fees must be paid and accounted for. That impacts margins, and year-over-year forecasting as well. Lems:\n\nThere's a lot of reporting around operational accountability. Have we processed all of our returns for today? Have we processed anything that is maybe in like, inventory investigations - type bin or location. That gets automatically reported on, blasted out to the people who need it. They see it every night; they're held accountable to maintaining the numbers correctly that are in those reports every day.\n\nLems laid out a simple data rule:\n\nThe saying in the company is: \"If it didn't happen in Acumatica, it didn't happen.\" So the reporting that comes out of Acumatica is how we run our entire business. It's kind of the linchpin to everything.\n\nLems team is keeping busy - they just brought the Dallas business into Acumatica as of October 2020. As for the biggest benefit of the new platform, well, that depends on your role. For Lems, it's about the integration capabilities. \"Once you can integrate to a system like that, you can do pretty much anything,\" he says. For other users, it's about visibility:\n\nProbably the number one benefit is the visibility and transparency into the business. What's going on every day? Where is it going on? And where do we need to focus to meet our goals? It's that capability to see everything.\n\nBut in this most unusual year, perhaps the best thing was having a lifeline from home into the operations of the business. Lems says that Zoom was the top application for keeping employees connected - but Acumatica was a close second:\n\nAside from Zoom, it's probably the number one app that pulled everybody together during that time.\n\nFor those who have been around ERP systems a long time, that's a whole new way of thinking. I'd argue that's what ERP was supposed to be doing all along."}, {"title": "Firms Combine Logistical Capabilities to Support the NHS", "link": "https://www.supplychaindigital.com/logistics/edinburgh-join-logistical-capabilities-support-nhs", "date": "None", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "['combine', 'firms', 'palletised', 'support', 'nhs', 'uk', 'frontline', 'services', 'group', 'logistical', 'edinburgh', 'freight', 'capabilities', 'workers', 'sanitiser', 'palletways']", "summary": "Pickering\u2019s Gin at Summerhall Distillery switched its available resources during the height of the pandemic to develop and produce hand-sanitising spray to help keep frontline workers safe.\nIt\u2019s logistics partner, Palletways Edinburgh , part of Palletways \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and fastest-growing express palletised freight network, and part of Imperial Group, transported goods to the NHS, emergency services, schools and care homes across Scotland.\nSo far, the distillery has produced over 90,000 bottles of hand sanitiser for frontline services including the armed forces, care homes and pharmacies across the UK.\nVanda Roberts, general manager at Palletways Edinburgh, said: \u201cDespite the challenges, our services continued throughout the crisis.\nThe Palletways Group comprises 450+ depots and 23 hub operations, through which it provides collection and distribution services across 24 European countries, including the UK.", "text": "Pickering\u2019s Gin at Summerhall Distillery switched its available resources during the height of the pandemic to develop and produce hand-sanitising spray to help keep frontline workers safe.

Being able to attest to the history of the device to prove its provenance and chain of custody is essential to make sure quality is consistent and that chips only do what they are supposed to do, and nothing more.\n\n\u201cWith blockchain, trustees can look at who did what in the supply chain and how those things came into the value chain,\u201d said Tom Katsioulas, head of trustchain business at Mentor, a Siemens business.\n\nBut blockchains, especially when used for individual systems, can involve an enormous amount of data. How that data is optimized and how the load on validators is managed are key elements to be worked out as interest in this field grows. And not everyone sees blockchain as inevitable in the future.\n\nMore than just identity\n\nCounterfeiting is a real and growing problem. \u201cWe have several customers who are very concerned about counterfeiting and other security issues, and they are thinking of multiple ways to secure their ICs and systems,\u201d said Geoff Tate, CEO of Flex Logix.\n\nThis is partly the role of identity, but identity may not be sufficient without the further knowledge of the history of the item. And that history can involve an enormous range of considerations. How much to include must balance the cost of tracking and storing data about huge numbers of individual components and systems against the consequences of having too little historical information.\n\n\u201cBlockchains provide a convenient means to permanently record transactions, and they have application to the provenance of components,\u201d said John Hallman, product manager for trust and security at OneSpin Solutions.\n\nDave Huntley, business development at PDF Solutions and co-chair of three SEMI committees/task forces, elaborated further. \u201cWhen a new asset like a package is assembled, it is enrolled as a brand-new asset on the blockchain, along with its bill of materials,\u201d he said. \u201cYou now have a genealogy, and you could take a module from a car, open it up, figure out the printed circuit board and slide it out, open that up, look at the packages inside, open one of them up, and look at the die inside. And every step of the way, you could be pinging the identifier and issuing a \u2018verify\u2019 transaction.\u201d\n\nThese histories are often seen as being of greatest value in retrospect, mainly for traceability. But they also can help prospectively. If an item is transported from one place to another, for instance, the departure and arrival can be logged, and it can establish the chain of custody for acceptance at the new location.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also useful in certain kinds of compliance environments,\u201d said Logan Spears, CTO of Sixgill. \u201cWe have a pilot with a company that does clinical trials, where there\u2019s a high incentive to mess with the data and support the conclusions that you want to support. But having a mathematically verifiable way to say, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s not the case,\u2019 adds value.\u201d\n\nBlockchain technology, most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, provides one way of accumulating a history. While not everyone is convinced that blockchain is the future for supply-chain management, it appears to be the only mechanism that has achieved some commercial traction, mostly outside the semiconductor industry.\n\nA blockchain is a ledger, much like a bank book, but it has two critical characteristics for helping to establish trust \u2014 It\u2019s distributed and it\u2019s immutable. Because this technology may roll out in the future for electronic systems, much of what follows deals with what is possible rather than the exact way that blockchains would roll out. There are many design decisions that must be made individually for each application.\n\nBlockchain isn\u2019t new, of course. Spending on blockchain technology is forecast to grow as much as 50% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Its use for managing the supply chain is also not new. Data from IDC shows that around 22% of blockchain usage lies in manufacturing. Silicon manufacturing is not yet a part of that number.\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Industry usage of blockchain technology. Data source: IDC\n\nDistributed ledger\n\nThe fact that a ledger is distributed means that it\u2019s not stored in one central location. Instead, the entire ledger is replicated many times in many places in a network. New entries to the ledger must be approved by a form of \u201cconsensus\u201d among the various nodes of the network. Only if the transaction is approved by some threshold percentage of the nodes will the entry be permanently placed on the ledger.\n\nThe idea here is to protect the ledger from being attacked or manipulated. The assumption is that as long as there are many nodes, then no one can interfere with enough of them to affect the contents of the ledger. Bogus entries would not hit the threshold for approval, while legitimate entries couldn\u2019t be blocked. That means networks must be very large to make any such attempted interference mathematically improbable.\n\nThe approval of a transaction happens algorithmically on computers. It\u2019s not that the owners of the computers personally intervene in the decision. Computers remain online and process work that\u2019s sent to them. Exactly what that work might be will vary both by algorithmic decisions and by the type of network chosen.\n\nThere are two kinds of networks \u2014 permissionless (or \u2018public\u2019) and permissioned (or \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018consortium\u2019). In a permissionless network, the members are anonymous, and anyone can join or leave. In order to reduce the opportunities for mischief, each approval must be accompanied by some type of task. For Bitcoin, it was a \u201cproof of work\u201d \u2014 solve a really hard problem. That\u2019s an energy-intensive approach, so alternatives are being explored.\n\nPermissioned networks, by contrast, use only members that have been explicitly approved for participation. This can reduce the workload required when approving entries, which can be a benefit for making enormous numbers of transactions efficient and for saving energy. The details of the approval processes can be rather involved, which makes it important that it all works smoothly, with no need for participants to understand the details of what\u2019s happening in the background.\n\nVarious companies have commercially available blockchain offerings. Some companies may have different network structures for different applications. Those networks come with the consensus participants in place. It\u2019s not necessary to create a new consensus network for each application.\n\nImmutability\n\nThe other key characteristic of a blockchain is that it\u2019s considered, or at least intended, to be \u201cimmutable.\u201d Once an entry is approved, it cannot be changed. With a well-managed bank book, one doesn\u2019t change an entry by crossing out the old numbers and writing in new ones. Instead, the old numbers remain and an adjustment is added as a new entry to preserve the history. Of course, with a bank book, one is relying on a human to follow procedures. With blockchain, the structure itself is intended to provide immutability.\n\nThis is accomplished using cumulative hashes. With each new entry, a hash is added to the ledger. But it\u2019s not simply a hash of the new entry. The hash includes the hash following the prior entry. That hash, of course, includes the entry prior to that, all of the way back to the very first entry. In other words, the last hash of the ledger incorporates the entire history of the ledger. If you go and change a past entry, then it\u2019s not enough to change the hash for that entry to cover one\u2019s tracks. Every hash following that one would have to be changed, which is a daunting task. It also would put that particular copy of the ledger out of sync with others on the network.\n\nSo it\u2019s while it\u2019s possible to change an entry, it\u2019s nearly impossible to do so undetected.\n\nA wide range of possible things to include\n\nThe number of possibilities for information to be included in a ledger is enormous. Safety-critical and other high-security applications may apply many of them. Lower-value systems may use less. But there are numerous opportunities for inclusion before, during, and after a unit is manufactured. \u201cThe recording of transactions could be done for basic data or with more complex data, like design information, verification results, process information, parameters, or test information,\u201d said OneSpin\u2019s Hallman.\n\nEach device\u2019s history starts with design. Exactly how that design process is managed will vary according to the device. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have RTL design, and you better be able to trace every step in the process,\u201d said Mentor\u2019s Katsioulas. \u201cAnd you can do that with blockchain.\u201d\n\nA semiconductor chip will follow a particular tool flow, and the tools used, along with verification results, can be entered onto a ledger. Any individual unit could then incorporate that design ledger to attest to the completeness and correctness of the design. This might seem pedantic, but it could help in situations where an initial design is modified. A given unit would then be attributable to either the old or new design, which is useful information for failure analysis.\n\nWhile the design history is inherited by all units built from that design, manufacturing establishes a history for each individual unit. Each manufacturing step can be entered, along with results from metrology and tests. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the product, but also the tooling that made the product so that the audit trail can go all the way from the end consumer use case, through the product, through the logistics of the product, through the tooling for the product, all the way to the origin of all the materials, whether that was from the supplier or done in-house,\u201d said Chris Kaufield, CFO of Alitheon.\n\nManufacturing applies to individual components themselves, their assembly into boards and sub-systems, and final integration into a full system. \u201cYou start your process of assembling the board with resistors, capacitors and chips, where the assembly process is potentially traced using blockchain technology,\u201d said Katsioulas. \u201cYou capture all the metadata for what goes in/what goes out.\u201d\n\nMost of this is automatic. \u201cYou enroll the device when it first powers up,\u201d said Huntley. \u201cSo then the world becomes aware on the blockchain that this device has been born into the world with a unique \u2018DNA.\u2019 And you put that DNA into the blockchain as a combination of the identifier and the challenge response pairs you need to be able to validate it in the future. The company that does that is saying, \u2018I built this thing, and I say it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll components can be verified and recorded either by identity or by lot. \u201cA box full of tape-and-reels could be considered as an asset record on the blockchain,\u201d Huntley explained. \u201cA board manufacturer would open up the box, and then they would put the reel on, load a package off that reel, and read the package ID. They could verify that the package ID did belong to this reel. So who put the reel in the box, who put the package on the on the reel \u2013 those things could be identified.\u201d\n\nThe need for manufacturing throughput, however, can limit what can be done during assembly. The verification steps might be done only when tracing back the provenance of the materials in a forensic operation.\n\nComponent authentication also can be recorded. Alitheon mentions, for example, that it can validate a component used in an assembly at any step of the process. The \u201cfeature print\u201d being captured can be entered onto the ledger \u2013 or at least the fact of taking the feature print and confirming its validity. This can help to establish a chain of validation events in the event that, for instance, one component is removed from a system and replaced by another. At some point, component authentication will fail, and the ledger can help to determine where that change happened.\n\nOne challenge is that such manufacturing data is often closely guarded, both by the foundries and by the companies owning the devices. \u201cAll that data is private. Nobody wants to share it,\u201d said Huntley. \u201cThe only data you will get back is going to be based on the contract you have with that supply-chain partner. He\u2019s not going to give you all the data. He\u2019s going to give you what you\u2019ve agreed to, and there\u2019ll be systems in place that guarantee the security of that data exchange.\u201d\n\nGoods may be transported between fabs during manufacturing or between warehouses afterward. While steps are being taken to thwart tampering while a unit is en route, recording the transaction further establishes the chain of custody.\n\n\u201cWhen a wafer ships, they will record the fact that the wafer itself is an asset, that they\u2019re shipping this way, and that it contains all these dies with all these other assets,\u201d said Huntley. \u201cIt also can include the fact that it\u2019s now departing from this location and headed to that location, recording the GPS coordinates. And, most recently, a lot of people are putting an odometer onto the device too.\u201d Transfers between handlers or vehicles also could be recorded, including final receipt at the destination.\n\nThere\u2019s another possible event to be recorded in association with transport, as well. When a silicon wafer, for example, moves from a foundry to an assembly house, it changes location, but it doesn\u2019t change ownership or \u201ctitle.\u201d In contrast, when a finished unit is transferred to a sales warehouse, ownership may change, depending on how the sales process is structured. \u201cThere\u2019s another transaction that has to do the ownership stake,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it gets packaged and sent to a distributor, then there is a release of ownership transaction on the blockchain, and then an acquisition of ownership.\u201d\n\nManufacturing is followed by the operating life of a unit. Where that starts is subject to interpretation. Enrollment could happen at first power-up during the testing of the system, or it could happen upon first power-up by the end customer. In fact, these could be independent events, with both of them being recorded.\n\nGoing forward, any number of events could be recorded, including:\n\nPowering on and off;\n\nInternal software and hardware attestations;\n\nNetwork authentications;\n\nMajor operational events, which would depend on the application;\n\nBiST or monitoring events and results;\n\nErrors or warnings;\n\nChanges of location;\n\nChanges of user;\n\nServicing events, even calls for support if the support system were linked in, and\n\nChanges of ownership.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the end of the useful life of the system, at which point the unit is decommissioned. But just because someone is done with a unit doesn\u2019t mean it no longer can be used. It might have been replaced with a newer model, or it might have been broken and tossed, with someone else trying to repair it. It might contain components that could be removed and re-used.\n\nSome regions require the ability to re-use, remanufacture, or recycle systems and components. How that affects the ledger may be complicated. A simple change of ownership is straightforward, assuming that it\u2019s recorded. But a repair could be treated as yet another step in the life of the system, with one component \u2014 and its history \u2014 being replaced with a new component, which would come with its own history.\n\nSalvaged parts from a defunct unit might work the opposite way, where the component and its history would be detached from that of the original unit, which ceases to \u201cexist\u201d, and it may join a new system and become part of that system\u2019s history.\n\nThe following image shows what would be possible if everything were captured in blockchains. Given the number of components in a sub-system and the number of sub-systems in a system, this can become extremely verbose extremely quickly. That\u2019s where blockchain design decisions will decide what is important and what isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nFig. 2: An extreme illustration of a complex of blockchains. Each system shares a design, but incorporates individual sub-systems. Those sub-systems each have a design and incorporate components, each of which has a design and a manufacturing history. Repairs and salvaging can extend the web of relationships. How much of this is incorporated into any specific system is a blockchain design choice. Different blockchains may use different technologies. Source: Bryon Moyer/Semiconductor Engineering\n\nIn the figure above, the design of one component may use a different brand of ledger from the manufacturing of a sub-system or the run-time history of the full system. For this reason, there are some standards in other industries that define the syntax and semantics of the entries so that the data can be meaningfully exchanged between blockchains. \u201cHaving all ecosystems speak the same language is important,\u201d said Kevin Otto, senior director, community engagement at GS1, an organization involved in blockchain-related standards.\n\nBlockchain challenges\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that a unit would have every such event logged due to the volume and size of the ledger (bearing in mind that, in theory, every individual unit would have its own enormous ledger). So data storage and communication \u2014 and securing both \u2014 may limit exactly which of the events are important enough to track.\n\nThe tracking also adds friction to flows that are constantly under pressure to become simpler and more efficient. For example, a consumable medical item today would simply be trashed when its use was complete. Having to log that end-of-life event adds another step that\u2019s likely to be omitted, breaking the completeness of the ledger.\n\nLikewise, when units go from manufacturing to sales, they can be tracked when moving through the official channels \u2013 but unofficial channels may be a problem. \u201cBlockchain works great when it comes to franchise distribution,\u201d said Uri Elhav, marketing and business development at Cybord. \u201cBut when you step into the broker, the spot market, it\u2019s a whole different story. And unfortunately, people go there.\u201d\n\nFor these reasons, blockchain processes work best when automated. The recording step then takes no extra effort. But that also assumes few or no escapes into a gray market of questionable authenticity.\n\nThen there are questions about whether or not a system can be gamed. Permissioned networks in particular may have fewer nodes than a public network. \u201cCould a nation-state mount some vast distributed attack on a ledger in order to invalidate it or manipulate it in a way that enables them to do things like fielding invalid devices?\u201d asked Alric Althoff, senior hardware security engineer at Tortuga Logic. If the ledger becomes corrupted, would that corruption then remain in place forever? If detected, could it ever be fixed?\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the reality of the moment. While various industries are taking up the blockchain solution, semiconductors \u2013 for design or manufacturing \u2013 aren\u2019t among them. \u201cThere\u2019s been no involvement in our area of the industry with blockchain,\u201d said Simon Rance, head of marketing at ClioSoft, a company heavily involved in design-data management. \u201cWe have customers, from FPGA design to analog PCBs, all the way to telecom companies, and companies doing consumer products, and none of them is even inquiring about blockchain. Where blockchain is getting a little bit more traction is in the manufacturing areas.\u201d\n\nSo blockchain has proponents and cautious doubters. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about blockchain,\u201d said Tortuga Logic\u2019s Althoff. \u201cBut we have to decide whether a distributed ledger is really what we want,\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cost and efficiency of so much tracking may limit the kinds of systems that maintain a thorough history. In an era where there appears to be no such thing as too much data, it remains to be seen whether blockchain is taken up only for sensitive systems, or whether it becomes business as usual across the board.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think blockchain will fix everything, but at least it starts to create that dialogue, because everybody\u2019s wanting to head in the same direction,\u201d said Michael Ford, chair of IPC-1782, -2591, and -2551 committees for the IPC.\n\nEven so, Huntley is keeping his eye on this prize. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely prevent counterfeits, and we can\u2019t completely prevent security breaches,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can detect them quickly. And we can track them, find the bad actors quickly, and punish them.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNew And Innovative Supply Chain Threats Emerging\n\nBut so are better approaches to deal with thorny counterfeiting issues.\n\nUniquely Identifying PCBs, Subassemblies, And Packaging\n\nNew approaches to preventing counterfeiting across the supply chain.\n\nWho\u2019s Watching The Supply Chain?\n\nThe proliferation of advanced packaging and heterogeneous architectures adds some new risks."}, {"title": "IBM uncovers global email attack on Covid vaccine supply chain", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/ibm-uncovers-global-email-attack-on-covid-vaccine-supply-chain-.html", "date": "2020-12-03 00:00:00", "authors": "['Noah Higgins-Dunn']", "keywords": "['email', 'phishing', 'ibm', 'vaccine', 'companies', 'health', 'attack', 'uncovers', 'attacks', 'vaccines', 'global', 'supply', 'covid19', 'covid', 'chain', 'working']", "summary": "IBM cybersecurity analysts on Thursday said they uncovered an email phishing scheme targeting global coronavirus vaccine supply chains, and urged cold-chain companies to remain \"vigilant\" and \"on high alert.\"\n\"From there, the adversary could gain insight into internal communications, as well as the process, methods and plans to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.\"\nIBM said the attacks likely targeted organizations linked to Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which is working to supply low- and middle-income economies with an affordable coronavirus vaccine.\n\"Gavi has strong policies and processes in place to prevent such phishing attacks and hacking attempts,\" a spokesperson told CNBC on Thursday.\nSome governments have already warned of an increasing number of cyberattacks related to Covid-19 attempting to steal sensitive information on the vaccines, IBM said.", "text": "Joachim Kuhn, chief executive officer of Vac-Q-Tec, looks at global distribution screens at the company's factory in Wurzburg, Germany, on Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020.\n\nIBM cybersecurity analysts on Thursday said they uncovered an email phishing scheme targeting global coronavirus vaccine supply chains, and urged cold-chain companies to remain \"vigilant\" and \"on high alert.\"\n\nThe company's task force dedicated to tracking down Covid-19 cybersecurity threats said it discovered fraudulent emails impersonating a Chinese business executive at a credible cold-chain supply company.

The alliance, which is backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, operates a program alongside UNICEF to strengthen immunization supply chains to ensure the drugs are distributed equitably.\n\n\"Gavi has strong policies and processes in place to prevent such phishing attacks and hacking attempts,\" a spokesperson told CNBC on Thursday. \"We are working closely with our partners on security awareness to continue to strengthen these best practices.\"\n\nGavi did not detail whether the scheme accessed sensitive information regarding the vaccine distribution. IBM's analysts said the phishing campaign has the \"potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft,\" though it wasn't made clear which countries could be behind the emails.

The company uncovered similar email attacks in June on the medical protective gear supply chain for health-care workers.\n\nIn April, the World Health Organization said it had seen a \"dramatic increase\" in the number of cyberattacks targeting the United Nations health agency. The organization said on April 23 that around 450 \"active WHO email addresses and passwords were leaked online along with thousands belonging to others working on the novel coronavirus response.\"\n\nIBM said in its report Thursday that it \"urges companies in the COVID-19 supply chain \u2014 from research of therapies, healthcare delivery to distribution of a vaccine \u2014 to be vigilant and remain on high alert during this time.\""}]
