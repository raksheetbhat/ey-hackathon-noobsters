"published": "8 months ago", "transcript": " today our sort of topic is this idea of a Bionic supply chain yes and certainly sounds very futuristic why would you say historically it's been so difficult for humans to kind of interact with these machines the executives I talked to they don't see yet that the full value out of the supply chain has come huh and for my insight is it's because the humans were quite busy in trying to understand how can I collaborate with a machine it's much more demanding to do it with algorithms and to do it with Excel for example I think what has lost focus is a little bit that enter and supply chain management is about enter enter surprisingly it's not about focusing on a sub function it's about aligning and synchronizing the end-to-end supply chain and that in my eyes has lost a little bit of focus so now we have to enter into the Bionic type of thing too we emphasize that humans need to collaborate obviously with the help of machines and that is I think what has not happened yet and that is why some executives are frustrated because the investments haven't paid off therefore we are saying it needs a bionic operating model which is essentially for four elements it's first of all the guidance in the supply chain so the good old K P is what do we want to achieve with our supply chain secondly skills of course I mean totally different set of people who are capable of designing the end-to-end supply chain then the operating model which is in our belief a very much platform driven operating model to put the people who are synchronizing the supply chain together even physically together sometimes and then technological platform but maybe not at the the first one but as the the foundation of of course we need it and that in very few companies has been established so far and therefore I think historically that is a bit of a disappointed disappointment about the cheetah project this concept of a digital twin how does that kind of fit in with an idea of Bionic supply chain the idea to have a representation of the enter and supply chain and I fully agree with you it will never be a 100% accurate representation but at the moment we have a 10 percent accurate end-to-end representation so if there is something like a 80 percent good representation of the end-to-end supply chain and we start learning how the system dynamics in in the end-to-end supply chain is and if if I have a spike in demand forecast here what does it mean on my target inventory what does it mean how can I play around with my production sequence what does it mean on my supply side what are the scenarios the end-to-end scenarios that I can play through if we start thinking in this way then a digital twin in the best sense can be the vehicle to enable the people who are running the end-to-end supply chain to play around with scenarios and take smart decisions what would a successful supply chain initiative Bionic supply chain initiative look like the truth is there will I think there will always be human interaction needed so what we need to design for a successful supply chain is a human centric still operating model which will run the supply chain of the future and that is the operating model elements that I have described earlier"}, {"id": "8IcBHjYFwZ8", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcBHjYFwZ8",

another edition of a firmsconsulting case video today we're going to look at operations cases and I must say that invariably I find most candidates struggle with operations cases it seems that everyone wants to be a strategy consultant everyone spends their time looking at strategy cases such as how do you enter a market what do you do if a product line is failing how do you deal with the deregulation of the market and while those are exciting cases and to be fair I used to be a corporate strategy consultant so you know I do find them interesting the reality is that operations cases are an essential part of case interviewing and you have to understand them and to be honest operations cases are more difficult than strategy cases because in strategy cases most people can figure their way through them but in operations cases unless you really understand the language and you have some context you are going to fail so what we're going to do is we're going to present an Operations case here that tests whether you understand the basics or the first principles of operations if you don't understand the first principles of operations you would not be able to solve this case and invariably you would not be able to solve the even more complex operations cases and as I mentioned many times and as this case is going to show operations cases are numerically challenging because you tend to be dealing with unit allocations and little tiny numbers that you need to add up across now the thing about operations cases if you do want to learn about operations cases you can go read several books a book that we recommend is the book goal by I think it's dr. Eli Goldratt you don't need to read the whole book I think it's about 300 pages you could get a summary and there are many summaries available at that book in fact the two to three page summary just explain the core concepts would be more than enough for you but that is for a different day today we'll assume that you have an understanding of operations so you can maybe go ahead and pause this case and if you don't have an understanding we'll teach you the basics of operations the case we're going to do is a McKinsey case it's rated at the difficult level and it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to solve this case the math should come quick because it's basic math but the logic of how you're going to do these things should take a little bit longer the case is Pepsi has one major Balkan plot in Los Angeles in last three month months inventory as more than doubled while customer complaints that's the people that Pepsi Bottling Company is delivering the cans of Cola to or the bottles of Cola are complaining because basically we don't know why but their complaints have gone up fivefold so what so the question is what would you do well in a real case the first thing you got to do is understand all of the information you've been presented with so for me personally the thing that stands out there that I'm not very clear about is when they talk about customer complaints they haven't explained why there are customer complaints right and as you know as we teach our candice if you experience or you've given a lot of data the odds are pretty good that they're expecting a framework before any clarifying questions right that's - pretty much my McKinsey and Baines handle cases and while this is the McKinsey case I've kind of presented it like a BCG model with very little data the conceptual issues are hidden and you've got to dig it out in a McKinsey case they tell you really really clearly this is the only problem there are no curveballs move ahead with the case right so let's now explore this case given the fact that so little information has been presented to us I think it's fair to say that we can ask additional questions but even so just to be fair I would always check with the interviewer whether he wants my clarifying questions or where they wants to see my approach first let's assume this is a friendly guy he had breakfast this morning and he's really happy to have a good chat with you so what are the questions I would ask him well firstly inventory could mean many things is it finished inventory that's sitting in a warehouse or is it inventory in progress that's an inventory that's arriving from suppliers very important point because depending on the inventory you have it's either a delivery problem or it's a production problem because inventory in progress is coming into the manufacturing process finished goods inventory as left the manufacturing process or says why am i wire customers complaining that's an obvious one I think many of us would have picked that up if we were doing this case I'd like to know about how much we want to reduce inventory and customer delivery times I think that gives us a target we're trying to chase and as you know most candidates do struggle with cases because while they do the case as well they don't know where the deadline is if you know about how much the interviewer wants you to reduce inventory and customer delivery times you know when to stop the case when you reach that target then obviously I'd like to know are there any other objectives noise profitability return on investment return on invested capital are there any other targets we need to worry about and of course if there's more targets than just inventory in customer complaints the case becomes much more difficult because the more targets you are trying to chase the more things you have to keep in the back of your head so let's assume that we're told that all of the inventory some supplies that's coming in before the manufacturing process customers are complaining because they're you know delivery times have gone up dramatically triple to gone up to about five times inventory reduction and customer delivery time reductions as much as possible and there are no other objectives what do we do now well the next step should be quite obvious now that we've been given all this information I would take a few seconds I tell the interviewer I take a few seconds to gather my thoughts and I would present my key question how can we reduce inventory costs and customer delivery times at the LA bottling plant now the kind of framework we give you here is a framework that if you presented it to an interviewer he would be unhappy so listen very carefully what I'm going to tell you next he would be unhappy so that you need to handle this in a certain way so let's present the framework and show you how you handle it first you need to look at inbound logistics that is stuff that is coming into the manufacturing process we know there's a problem with supplies but we don't know if it's a problem with suppliers right there could be a parameter supplies on our side in the way we order or they could be a problem with supplies on the way they fulfill our orders manufacturing we've been given no indication that manufacturing is a problem right so for now we just assume there's no problem there and we know the in terms of outbound logistics we have some information saying that deliveries our problem for those of you are not familiar with this this entire three-step process is known as the supply chain if you go into an interview and tell an interview I'm going to analyze the entire supply chain that's my framework they will laugh at you or they'll throw something at you hopefully something that heavy so what you've got to tell an interviewer that preempt them say look I understand this is the entire supply chain by no means intend to say that this is my entire framework this is just some considerations that what I'm going to do now is identify which part I'm going to analyze and why that way we can narrow down our framework to just one point that we want to analyze and focus our case make sense let's continue the step from here is obviously asking a few questions to determine whether the problem lies in the inbound side on the manufacturing side or the outbound side and you've got to be efficient you can't ask a lot of questions you've got to ask one or two questions that eloquently and efficiently show you understand the problem so what would those questions be well firstly I would like to know why we are buying more materials well clearly there's some hold up there so why are we buying more materials has anything changed in the manufacturing process you'd be shocked how many people forget to answer ask this really basic question it just baffles me you know we've been doing this can't your cases with some Korean students recently and one of the things you've got to understand about the Korean education system is it's quite advanced but operations cases don't seem to be on the table on the menu for South Korean students they really good at strategy cases but they really mess up operations cases and I just did a session with about maybe five Korean students and all of them fail to get this issue now it's not just Korea that struggles yet because obviously an outstanding education system but we find invariably Candice from across the world struggle because no one is primed to think in operations terms outbound logistics I would like to know why customer orders are delivered late so look at the sequence here right we were told they are complaining then we found out why they're complaining because they are delivered late and now we want to know why they're delivered late so let's see what the interviewer tells us well he's going to tell me demand has gone up from six thousand bottles a day to ten thousand bottles a day since it is now summer that makes sense you know as demand goes up you'll buy more raw materials more inventory to fulfill demand they've changed nothing in the manufacturing so there's interesting because the manufacturing process for six thousand bottles is the same as the manufacturing process for ten thousand bottles not necessarily a good thing but a clue as well and customer orders are late because the factory is not producing sufficient Cola to meet demand and we have forced a can for shipment right that years some interesting clues for you that you can take and work with right and very basic stuff here basically due to demand an increase in demand more supplies are being bought but due to something in manufacturing those supplies are not being converted to finished products which is why there's a delayed customer so clearly there's a manufacturing problem we've got enough inbound supplies coming in but they're not being converted in the manufacturing process and obviously the outbound process is failing because there's nothing to take from manufacturing to customers so let's explain this with some numbers right let's look at the former state before demand went up demand was six thousand bottles a day right so my hypothesis is that due to a bottleneck or other manufacturing problem this is causing an inventory buildup and manufacturing shortfall which is leading to customer delays and notice the fact that I've got three parts to my hypothesis and I pollicis can never be that there's a manufacturing problem that is an hypothesis that belongs in a non accredited college if you go to an accredited college you should understand lipolysis must have three parts you must have the observable phenomenon the cause and the effect if you gave me an iPod thesis with just two of the three parts I'm okay with it but if you give me a hypothesis that cannot be tested if you just tell me something like there's a manufacturing problem and you cannot test it that's never going to fly so let's look at this in a graphical layout so let's lay out the manufacturing process let's assume there's just three parts to the manufacturing process right the first part is where you get the bottles and you sterilize it and let's assume the capacity of that plant for a day of that part of the plant per day is 10,000 bottles a day filling of the bottles with Cola the capacity is 9000 bottles a day and the bottling when I mean bottling I mean putting a cap on those bottles is 8,000 bottles a day right so let's look what happens on a typical week you've got six thousand bottles six thousand bottles bought because that's the demand per day the product deficit that means that the product the demand that is not met is zero because all six thousand can go through the production process because the bottleneck is above six thousand and that happens for the whole week from day 1 to day 2 to day 3 today for today 5 so everyone's happy all the customers are happy right but what happens in demand close to 10,000 bottles a day well the bottling side where you're putting a cap becomes a bottleneck because we've demand exceeds supply you have a bottleneck and if you have a bottleneck it's automatically a production problem so now we know we have a bottleneck and what does that mean in terms of happy or happy customers well lets them erase this and see what that means so we now have 10,000 bottles of inventory being bought right that's logical right what is the product deficit well in the first day you can have 10,000 bottles going into the manufacturing process and being queued up only 8,000 bottles are going to come up so in terms of the product deficit demand not being met we have 2,000 bottles not being met right make sense let's go to day two right in day two what's going to happen well in date two what you have is that from day one you've got 2,000 bottles that have queued up I was in excess inventory so waiting to come in and then in day - you've got the $2,000 bottle deficit from day one plus the two thousand two thousand bottle deficit from day two giving you four thousand bottles of demand that are not being met day three same thing right in day two you now have four thousand bottles queuing up plus the two thousand that are going to come in from day three you've got a six thousand bottle deficit and you can simply repeat the process now what happens when you repeat the process is you find out that this very innocuous bottleneck problem is causing a dramatic queue whereby by the end of the first week you're going to have 10,000 bottles queuing up and if 10,000 bottles are queuing up for manufacturing that means 10,000 bottles that need to go through manufacturing and not going through manufacturing and you've got a product deficit of 10,000 now that we've outlined this problem hopefully a little bit eloquently what do we do with this well if you've identified the problem the next step is obviously to generate options to fix said problem you have two options here the first option is you can fix the bottleneck so that all the supplies are used and there is no product deficit and/or inventory buildup now McKinsey particularly and I would say all firms want to see creativity I get really bored of the case when someone is just throwing out the most basic stuff right so let's look for a really creative answer yeah we know this is a seasonal problem because during summer the problem occurs so another more creative solution is that we shift production to a neighboring water like maybe I don't know in the VAD I think it's close to California and we import the product deficit into Los Angeles we clay could even shift production to maybe a neighboring bottle maybe in San Diego San Francisco somewhere within California but the point is you don't have to necessarily do any changes to the LA plant now obviously here you gotta prioritize which option do you analyze first right once you've presented your options you've got to analyze them you've got to analyze them on certain criteria and decide which option you want to pursue dealing with your own plant is probably the best thing to do because potentially there are ways to fix your bottleneck without incurring significant cost you want to look at that first and only if that's not a solution then you look at making massive capital changes or shifting production so let's explore that let's take this even further right so fixing if you want to fix the bottleneck we have three options we can move quality lashawn's before the bottleneck I can show you right now when I tell people this is a potential solution they look at me with a blank face or they look at they look at me like I just told them the earth is actually flat and it's not round expanding the bottleneck is an obvious solution that's what most people say and sharing the bottleneck work with another part of the plant they may be another part of the plant who could do the same work as the bottleneck with a few changes so this is creative and it's usually possible because what happens is plants do have spare equipment or they do have other equipment that can do the work of the bottleneck so now let's look at the one about moving QA before the bottle like I'm going to explore this in more detail because it's the one most people to understand the least but of course all of them you have to explore right you have to look at the criterion what is the cost-benefit analysis of doing each to come up with a recommendation but we just going to look at the Q&A one because I think it makes the most sense here so let's look at moving Q&A before the bottleneck now what does this mean right let's go back to our plant we've got three steps in the plant sterilizing the bottles filling them up with Cola and I'm putting a little cap on them on the day one we've got 10,000 bottles if the bottleneck is 8,000 we assume 8,000 bottles will come out but it's not true the apparent capacity of the plant is only a hundred percent that is to the apparent capacity is 100 percent in reality you are going to have some defects occurring let's assume the defects are 5 percent right which is 400 bottles the real capacity of the plant is 95% and if you spread this across you know you're losing $400 a day for the plant right so 5 percent of products going through the bottleneck will be rejected meaning the bottleneck is not working on hundred percent capacity but rather just 95 percent capacity so what you can do is you can see here that if you look at the losses they're quite significant they keep on adding up every single day right it's four hundred a day if you can move the queue a step before the bottleneck right you would remove these products before they entered the bottleneck so rather than sending only seven thousand five seven thousand six hundred good products to the bottleneck you would send eight thousand products to the bottleneck because the products that we're going to be kicked out after the bottleneck would be kicked out before the bottleneck thereby only sending good products to the bottleneck what this means is that if you move the QA or part of the QA before the bottleneck you ensure maximum product is produced but now the case you have to ask yourself is well you can fix this and it's quite easy to fix should you make capital expansions to address the 1600 bottles that you still need to find remember demand is ten thousand if you've found another four hundred you've got eight thousand four hundred moving through which means you've got one thousand six hundred bottles that are not moving through now since this is seasonal importing seems to make more sense to me I would actually say why go through all these capital changes when just for four or five months of the year we can get another plant to work it may be slightly high capacity without any chain just to their production right so let's just recap where we've come with this case well you've got to tie up the case right and that's what you and I mean what's what I mean when I say recap this is what I'll do I'll tell them interview that in this case the inventory build-up and delays and customer deliveries are driven by the same problem right it's basically a bottleneck in the bottling step of the bottling plant and they fix the problem we can do many things but the simplest thing we can do immediately would least amount of effort is move QA before the bottleneck we can improve throughput capacity by five percent and we assume it'll cost us nothing right this means that we still need to find another one thousand six hundred bottles per day right and there are two ways we can address this we can introduce capital expansion into the plant or we can shift capacity to another plant that may have idle capacity right and of course comparing the capital side of things capital changes and conveying the option the broad option of shifting capacity to another plant will have to do a cost-benefit analysis but all other things being equal shifting it because it's seasonal and it's going to come back to normal shifting it another plant would tend to make the most amount of sense to me so now that we've covered this case let's sort of recap some of the key things you need to know the observations here is that in the supply chain everything needs to be broken down into three convenient steps but you've got to understand that this is a very broad process and if you just tell the interviewer you're going to go with the entire supply chain they're not going to be happy so you have to quickly follow that by saying that I'm going to use a few sets of clarifying questions to pinpoint where I think the problem is and develop a hypothesis and that is where we will focus the analysis when you think of a supply chain you should think of a set of dominoes you move one part of the Domino there's a ripple effect across the supply chain your job is to find the relationship between these seemingly unrelated problems because here we saw that infantry was a problem and customers at no time did we think that manufacturing could be a problem until we understood the relationship of the different parts of production in a supply chain I'll tell you again operations cases of a numerical require lots of calculations and I love doing them with candidates in the final stages of the training one of the most famous cases we do is a Russian mobile telecommunications case looking at how dropped calls increases during the Russian which in Moscow peak rush hour between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock failure rate on that case sets are closed about a hundred percent and I always find that candidates make mistakes there because of unit conversions you're dealing with bottles per day bottles per cycle set up a time number of people per hour labor cost per a unit of product you don't use units you are going to die for those of you who are in our training and have gone through our estimation cases you know how important unit conversions are in operations cases I think of a very big estimation case with a lot of different equations equations without units is language without structure no structure no understanding everything fails operations cases can always be broken down to three steps if you don't understand bottlenecks and operations cases you are dead understand that process the principles of solving operations cases for those of us with those if you've been through the training you know we we take this directly into estimation case when you look at supply and demand we're taking the telecoms cases we take it heavily into IT cases the point is knowing operations cases is not just important for operations cases it's important for all kinds of cases now if you really want to improve your knowledge you should understand marginal cost analysis because I find that when we start when we when we give you a case with an Operations concept and marginal costing I would say most candidates fail them most candidates really struggle to understand this concept and you should look it up because in future cases that you do with us we are going to throw this concept at you these cases tend to be very long there's no way you're going to be able to go through inbound logistics manufacturing outbound logistics on top to bottom you'd be there forever your job is to quickly pinpoint the problem let the interviewer know that you know the framework is too big and that you understand you have to pinpoint the problem right so let's just look at how candidates have done generally in this case so what we've done here is we've taken a case summary looking at how candidates have done across the last two years with us on this kinds of cases in terms of case skill requirement you have to be very good at case structuring and very good at communication to solve operations case it's very good a case structuring because if you have the wrong structure you are basically going around in a maze or you're gonna have to if you use the wrong structure the structure may tend out to be so cumbersome to use you are never ever going to develop it right you're never going to solve the problem the second thing is because you're dealing with so many units of calculations and bottles per day cost per hour units per second unless you are really communicating what you want to do why you want to do it how you want to do it there's a great chance of miscommunication I know many candidates will resonate with the point I'm going to make if you ask me the wrong question and I answer the question correctly you are screwed and I do find that with many candidates what they want to ask me and what they ask me is the interviewer is very different from what they intend to ask and if you ask the wrong question I give you the right information for the wrong question you're going to end up being totally lost in a case especially when you're dealing with these very nuanced units of conversion but how do candidates do well I would say that the reason this case is so challenging is because it expects you to understand operations cases at its core the case is not challenging but the principles it applies means you must understand operations and if you don't well you know what you did how do candidates do I find MBA candidates do okay in this case they tend to do well on business judgment they tend to be do well in case structuring because most MBA schools have taught in operations costs and a lot of candidates can bring that to the table but I can tell you right now all MBA students struggle and I don't think anyone's ever finished this case so while their business judgment may be strong they're not able to parlay that into communicating with me effectively to extract good insights from me as the interviewer but also from extracting guidance from me and case structuring our find to be quite a weak for MBA candidates what I do find is that undergraduates tend to be a weak on communication and weaken business judgment and they weaken business judgment here because I do find that undergraduate programs in business and generally history art scientists don't teach operations so operations is something you've got to read and the only reason I post sorry undergraduate students do badly it's because they don't have this operations background but I do still feel that our undergraduate candidates do better on the arithmetic and calculations in our MBA candidates and this is looking across the last year and sort of averaging out performance for all the candidates who have been through the program why will you fail this case you have week operations knowledge you need to get the summary of operations from any MBA textbook and you'll be fine as always I'll be happy to respond to any questions and I do hope that you found this case to be very useful to your preparation and training thank you"}, {"id": "ZCmndpTNRb4", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCmndpTNRb4", "title": "Digital Supply Chain of the

technology is changing the way you know goods and services are getting delivered to consumers and consumers access goods and services that requires whether your strategic objectives of the company are aligned to what you want to do in the supply chain we found that supply chains are I'm going to go through a big shift over the next few years there is a reshoring that's happening you know in several markets closer to demand but be it United states-mexico some parts of Western Europe and as these manufacturing setups or the networks get a redesign that will have a big impact on how supply chains player role going forward with emerging technologies and digital supply chain as we call it will have two broad impacts one new business models will emerge existing business models will get will get destroyed or will get absolute and the second will be efficiencies in systems and processes now the pace at which this is moving as a company we see if you're not going to take action on either of these or if you're not going to build capabilities in technology and digital let me have a longer-term adverse impact in the business all of these in according to us is not going to be possible as an overlay on your existing supply chain of business you actually have to bake the technology in digital aspect into your business model into your organization into your processes and not as an afterthought of overlaying it you need to redesign you know how a performance measures work you need to make sure collaboration with the supply chain partners is enhanced and and those are built into you the way you collaborate and work with them and similarly you need to build capability in the front end in terms of how you deliver these products and services digital supply chain is clearly something that many clients are asking for at this point in time they want to build capability with assisting several of them from you know from one level of saying how do you use gigabytes of data that exist within your organization and how do you use and process that to be able to drive inside and and improve the efficiency of your process on one hand and on the other hand we were working with

"channel": "Boston Consulting Group", "duration": "2:20", "views": 927, "published": "9 years ago", "transcript": " the biggest challenge companies face today when it comes to supply chain is understanding how supply chain can drive competitive advantage that's difficult for multiple reasons the first one is that our supply chain requirements will vary by product segment by Channel and geography and companies that need to recognize that in setup supply chains accordingly the second difficulty is the fact that these requirements evolve over time and as these requirements change supply chains need to adapt and so companies need to constantly be on the lookout to make sure their supply chain fits their requirements at all times a typical mistake that companies make when it comes to supply chain is a one-size-fits-all approach across all channels products and geographies most companies still operate in silos and therefore supply chain opportunities or requirements are neither well perceived nor understood it's key to think holistically about all functions involved in supply chain from sales and distribution back into manufacturing back into sourcing or even product design and actually supply chains need to be integrated upstream with suppliers and also downstream with customers and that is what a true intense supply chain needs to look like supply chain implementation requires a truly cross-functional effort while it can't be easy to define this connect the conceptual solutions it's extremely difficult to implement so supply chain directors or operations directors are usually leading this effort but the most successful companies I have seen are those companies were the CEO or the commercial director get involved and understand the supply chain challenges and trade-offs one key trend and supply chain over the last years has been to support faster and faster innovation with collapsing time to market cycles another evolution has been to juggle with more and more complexity as companies grow their product portfolios diversify their earlier channels and their geographies there's still a long way to go in general supply chain as a function is less embedded than sales or marketing manufacturing or product design I think it will be another five or ten years before companies fully leverage the power and the benefits of an effective supply chain when you look at it it great great big opportunity"}, {"id": "N-YMusEs37E", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-YMusEs37E", "title": "Strategy and Management Consulting Industry Overview: McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Accenture & More", "channel": "StrategyU", "duration": "10:34", "views": 19231, "published": "1 year ago", "transcript": " what do we mean when we talk about the consulting industry consulting is a word that has been used so much more in the business world part of this is because it has grown so rapidly over the past 20 to 25 years now there's a big difference between describing some of the work McKinsey Bain and BCG are doing which we'll dig into a little more and some of the other work that smaller players are or firms that are implementing technology solutions so we'll walk through some of the differences and the types of consulting and just talk about what makes the big three McKinsey Bain and BCG a little different the consulting industry has grown rapidly over the past 20 years and has a lot to do with the increased attention that the industry has gotten now in 2016 consultancy dot uk' size the market at about two hundred and fifty 1 billion dollars and also showed that it was growing at a greater than four percent rate annually there's basically five core areas they looked at operations financial technology HR strategy there's some subtle differences between these different areas and we'll dive down a little deeper to what we mean when we say strategy consulting so if we break it down into four different buckets and I've offered some example companies here so we have typical strategy and operations work these are the big firms they might answer a question that a client has such as how do I transform my company in the next five years these are big ambiguous complex problems that these firms are perfectly set up to deliver on with their global teams their deep knowledge infrastructure and their ability to scale up and really focus and dive down on a problem really quickly next is more HR and organization consulting this is often work around designing compensation programs what does it look like we're re our workforce and you have firms like executive search firms who are increasingly getting into this space and helping people with leadership assessments and helping with succession planning third is technology and implementation now this is probably some of the less sexy work of the consulting industry and this might help a client implement a new IT system over several years if anyone's had s AP or Oracle implementations at their company I'm sure there is a company like Accenture IBM behind the scenes helping with the implementation and fourth is an area called due diligence and this is really an assessment of for private equity companies and also mergers and acquisitions groups at big companies of saying how should we think about acquiring companies and then for practically should we buy or not buy this company so these projects tend to be very finite can be two-week projects maybe a little longer maybe a little shorter and are very intensely focused on like how do we understand the customer how do we understand the market and how does this company fit into our broader portfolio coming back to the breakdown of the consulting industry when we talk about strategy consulting in common business language now what are we really talking about we're really focused on three key key areas operations HR and strategy these core areas are typically the high-level problems and companies where the the CEO the board and other senior executives are focused on these areas and our leading major projects or initiatives to transform these areas strategy consulting can break down even further in a really eight core types of work you can have things like corporate strategy this can be work with the board saying what is the strategy it look like over the next three years how should we be thinking about it is our CEO aligned with the vision around this and what's happening in the market next could be something around mergers and this could be helping a company define what are the companies we should be targeting how should we be thinking about making things internally versus buying companies that do things and how should we be thinking about this market as it evolves over time organizational strategy this might look at in organizational redesign you might be moving from a functional set up to a business unit set up more around product you might also be looking at how can you transform the culture globally or at least in a local region next might be operations and this could be looking at how do we plan a supply chain network how do we operate and improve the efficiency of manufacturing plants across the globe how do we think are about our product development cycle and how that operates with engineers and finally an emerging and growing area is digital and this is in the strategy consulting bucket now because it's at the agenda of the CEO and the board everyone's thinking about this companies are thinking about how do we adapt to the future of work how do we think about machine learning technology how do we give employees the tools to do their job from anywhere and how are we accessing new markets with all these platforms and other technologies that exist now there's two buckets of strategy consultants if we break it down even further first is the pure play strategy firms you'll notice that these are typifies by the BC G's McKenzie's and Baynes but there's also some boutique players like AT&T le K Navigon and Oliver Wyman the latter four companies are a bit smaller and more boutique and BCG McKinsey and Bain are becoming massive companies who are operating all around the globe have large teams across most functions of a business and are increasingly entering new spaces like McKinsey with the McKinsey solutions and building tech startups internally to help shape what is the future of consulting look like now I alluded to the fact earlier that a lot of boutique firms don't exist anymore and these firms have been bought up by big four accounting firms and other historical consulting firms like IBM to help those firms broaden the services they offer to their customers and in this space you have firms like Accenture KPMG Ernst and Young these firms do a lot they do technology consulting they do audit work with accounting and are increasingly offering so many services like risk and also have these strategy groups that operate with varying levels of autonomy and independence internally you have firms like the Parthenon group that operates internally at E&Y and you have boozin company that was acquired by PwC that was renamed so what makes the big three different I've looked at this market for a while and there's a number of factors that both make them different in their size and scale of how they compete and how it makes the actual work in the consulting process and the depth of that a little different and basically what we'll be diving into in this course so they make a few operational decisions which really enable them to compete in a different way first and most important is that they charge the highest fees now one of the early influencers in shaping McKinsey and company Marvin Bower talked a lot about charging the high fees as a way to symbol that they were going to signal that they were going to do the best work now charging the highest fees gives the companies the ability to do a number of things it enables consultants to only have to work on one project at a time now add some other boutique firms and other firms in the big four space a lot of times consultants are working on more than one project at a time now this harms and basically makes it more challenging to go as deep as these firms can in terms of a structured problem-solving approach additionally they're also growing quite fast I know BCG has been growing in a crazy clip for the past 10 to 15 years and is always reinvesting more in people and training globally finally they have the most resources dedicated to training they make conscious choices about sending people to training for two weeks they take them out of the office and say this is all you need to worry about for two weeks and go super deep on what those problem solving processes are for at McKinsey I went through several full week trainings which were really intense and often times harder than some of the work I was doing during the working week but in each of those experiences you're getting hands-on coaching from other consultants and really at the end of the week in the weeks following the training you get the sense that you were able to level up your skills"}, {"id": "aqyV85Hg7uw", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqyV85Hg7uw", "title": "BCG's Pierre Mercier on Supply Chain Management", "channel": "Boston Consulting Group", "duration": "3:05", "views": 4068, "published": "6 years ago", "transcript": " major trends today are linked to the fact that companies are more and more global they're global in their sourcing so they're they're sourcing from all over the world and their global and their customer because temir bases as well what this means is they're facing more and more disruptive events more and more different forms and new forms of competition and as a result supply chains are becoming more complex and harder to manage a misalignment between strategy and supply chain will lead to a deterioration in performance so deterioration in the bottom line and the balance sheet so noticeably you have higher costs more inventory required lost sales but you also have indirect effects so the poor supply chain will lead to plants being underutilized sales being missed so there are quite a few impacts on on the bottom line too often I I work with clients where I will hear service levels of 99 percent and we're extremely happy with the service we deliver but when you ask clients how they see it it's a whole different picture and so understanding where the performance truly is starting from is a key point once you've done that there are a number of things you can do that around the strategy itself for the network so is the supply chain designed properly our processes lean enough and respected or are we using the right tools and what I find is that is also quite important to look at capabilities so talent and behaviors as well so are the right incentives in place it's extremely important that supply chain know what the true measures are not just optimizing the metrics but also ensuring that the business outcomes are there so when I say ninety-nine percent service level I should have extremely satisfied customers if I have 99 percent availability in a store as a shopper I should be able to find just about everything I'm looking for and too often there's a big discrepancy between what we think supply chain is delivering and what the reality is on the field we always ground that try to ground the effort with looping back to strategy so how is the supply chain supporting the strategy well and where is the supply chain not supporting the strategy and we do that using the combination of analysis internal/external we try to benchmark with competition we try to meet the management if if appropriate we'll talk to suppliers and we'll talk to some of the company's clients to get a realistic view you know what is the starting point where are the opportunities where are the issues based on that then we'll tend to focus on a portfolio of initiatives trying to balance the I suppose the medium-term design of the right supply chain but also focusing on short-term performance improvement to realize value quickly and in doing that it will it will encompass interventions on the strategy the network processes tools capabilities incentives everything that needs to be that needs to be managed for supply chain to work properly"}, {"id": "rlrv2VsD4Qg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlrv2VsD4Qg", "title":

interesting technologies digital technologies that allow them to get much more granular information real time information and that allows managers to make better decisions that makes them more flexible more versatile I think another important element that's going to come into play here has to do with global trade companies now are facing the harsh reality that you know changes in the global trade landscape are affecting them directly and for the first time in decades they're having to look for alternative suppliers in regions that they don't even operate in that's that's a big change and

technology at scale they aren't able to fully transform their companies and to ensure resilience in times of uncertainty an increasingly volatile and complex markets companies must be faster to adapt to changes in supply chain and customer needs and so we at bcg have gone and looked at what works and what doesn't we've studied how digital natives organize their companies we've looked at companies that are successfully transforming and we've even gone back to the industrial revolution the last time the technology of this power came into the world and what we found there was that the technology alone wasn't enough it wasn't until companies reorganized their factories no longer organized them around steam but organized them in a way that took maximum advantage of electricity it wasn't until they introduced the assembly line and the taylor organizational ways of working that they got full power out of the new technology full productivity out of the new technology and so what we've realized at bcg is that that's what we need today technology can radically enhance human capability [Music] mass data increases our knowledge ai makes us smarter we think faster and never forget anything and mobility means we can be anywhere at least on video at the click of a button robots and autonomous vehicles enhance our physical power but humans still have huge advantages over machines

the future will be bionic the bionic company consists of four key elements the first for companies just like today is strategy and purpose wrapped around that strategy and purpose are three key elements that we affectionately call the wheel at the top of the wheel are bionic outcomes that are driven by technology and humans personalized customer experiences more efficient and effective operations and new offers services and products now in order to achieve those bionic outcomes you need two enablers the first is the human touch we need to change the talent the ways of working the

"views": 7620, "published": "3 months ago", "transcript": " Hi I'm Jenny Rae Le Roux, the managing\ndirector of Management Consulted and an ex-Bain\nconsultant and I'm here with Matt Plummer. Matt\nthanks for joining us today. So Matt is an ex-Bridgespan consultant\nand also an alum of Yale for all of y'all\nout there that are huge Yale fans and I'm gonna walk through a case today\nwhere Matt is going to be in the hot seat as the interviewee, thank you for\nvolunteering. Sure. Very glad to have you. And we're\ngoing to run this case as a BCG style case today\nso it's going to be a little bit different than some of the other things\nthat we've worked on but it's one of the styles that we\nemploy in training at Management Consulted and it's actually the first\nstyle that we recommend when people are engaging with case interviews that they\ndo because as you're gonna notice, I'm gonna\nput a lot of the burden on you. I'm gonna ask you to defend everything\nthat you think, to walk through your structure, to identify what data you want,\nand to come up with your own conclusion so no pressure but you have to do all\nthe work. All right. Good to know in advance.\nGreat. So we're going to just begin with the\ncase. I'm going to give you the prompt and then as we normally would do just as\nyou have questions and dialogue. If this\nis an interview your whole future is on the line no big deal.\nSo there we go. All right. You ready? Yeah. Good. So our\nclient today is a company that is a medical device manufacturer.\nThe company we're going to call the very fancy name of needle needer.\nOkay. And needle needer manufactures a large variety of needles for different\nmedical applications. We're going to focus on one\nof their segments today because something is changing\nin their market. This segment is the segment where they supply blood\ndraw needles to laboratories. And they manufacture and they sell so\nthey do the full integrated supply chain for that.\nThey have a market that is about 200 million units\ntoday, and in total there are two competitors.\nNeedle needer and one other competitor that share the market in a duopoly.\nNow, what's changing in the market is that federal health care regulations\nare coming in that are mandating a different schedule\nof frequent blood draws for chronic patients,\nso they're gonna move this down on average about five percent\nof the market so the demand rate is going down by five percent,\nand this will decrease blood from let's say somebody who's chronic would\nbe 12 times a year they'd move down to 11 or\n10 times a year. Of course, there are other segments of the market but in\naggregate, five percent down and it's because of the frequency of the blood\ndraw mandates. Our client, this is an important part of\ntheir business, they don't want to lose profits but they're willing to get them\nin different ways and so our job is to be creative about\nhow they can maintain their current profit with these health\ncare regulations that are coming down. Do you have any questions about the\nbackground? Yeah absolutely. Do we expect that the five percent is\nsteady state like that it's going and if so is it going to go to that\nin like the next year or is it going to be a progressive decline? Great.\nSo the reason that we know about this is that it was actually mandated\na few years ago, but it's actually coming into effect next year,\nso now that we believe it's going to be realized, it should be realized\nin one year and it should be the new steady state. Okay.\nAnd do we know if the since it's already been mandated previously,\nhas the competitor already taken action on the basis of that or\ndo we not know? So far, nothing has changed in our market, so we are where we\nwere, but the question is where are we gonna\ngo? Okay, sounds good. Good. So it sounds like we want to know how\nthey can maintain their profitability in a shrinking market. Yep. So is it all\nright if I take a minute or two to put together a structure for that? Do all\nthe time you need. All right. Okay. So the profitability is going to be\na factor of four different variables. Okay.\nSo, first price clearly. Then the variable cost, so how much cost\nare they spending on a unit basis, and then obviously the volume and the\nfixed costs. My sense is that those first two are\ngoing to be the most important. From a fixed cost standpoint you know, they're\nthey're already creating 200 million units and so\nI would expect that they'd be operating at pretty good economy of scale in a\nsense since that's quite a good volume already\nand you know an incremental volume increase won't dramatically change the\nfixed cost, so I'd expect that to be stable and not much to be done there\nunless there's some technological advances that can be done,\nwhich we don't know. The volume if we're the volume is going to be pretty much\nthe same and we're talking about a five percent\ndecline, so I would focus on the price and the variable cost,\nand there on the price what we would want to know is how does\ntheir price compare to the competitor's price.\nAnd so is that something that you can provide? In a second.\nOkay. Tell me everything you want first. And then and\nthen at a variable cost level and so related to price we would want to know\nboth the price but we'd also want to know the profitability of the\ncompetitor. Okay. And so to do that we would also need to know roughly their\nif we assume their fixed costs are roughly equal to our own, then\nwe want to know basically what is their price and what is their variable\ncost. Then we would also need to know\nour own variable cost of of needle needer. That\nalliteration is getting me. Yeah but so that we could\nunderstand how does our cost compare to theirs, because\nessentially the two main strategies will be either\nto drop our own costs, or to lower our price in order to gain\nmarket share. Okay. And so in that \nwith those being the two levers, yeah. Okay, so now\nyou can ask for data. Okay. By the way you said\nall the things that it could be, but if you had to pick one,\nwhat would you say it would be? It's the only one you get to pick to go after,\nwhat is it? So my guess would be that\nif these two you know two companies are controlling most of the market that\ntheir price are roughly similar, and so and \nso that I would be most interested in understanding if\nthe cost structure is different underneath it, so\nit seems like the biggest opportunity would be to\nunderstand if the price can be reduced.\nOkay. And to gain market share. Yeah\ngreat, all right good. So what do you want to look at first?\nSo first I would like to know, is my assumption that\nboth entities are pricing the needles at roughly the same amount?\nThat's a fair assumption. Okay. What is that price? Yeah, you bet.\nAnd so it's two dollars per needle. Okay. And then do we know the\nthe variable cost of our client? We do,\nyeah. So we we looked at the way that they\nsource, they actually source differently than we do, they outsource\neverything from beginning to end. Their price per unit is one dollar and forty\ncents. Okay, so that's for the competitor is one\ndollar and forty cents. And then our own and that's variable\ncost there. And for needle needer itself, \nthe variable cost there. Yes it's one dollar and twenty cents. So this is a good starting place, the\nfact that our costs are lower than theirs,\nwhich suggests that you know before we think about trying to reduce our own\ncosts, which we haven't looked into yet but is\nstill an option, it suggests that if we were to drop the\nprice we would be able to, that they would lose\nprofitability and eventually you know lose their margin before we\nwould. Okay. And so that seems like the first area that I would want to look\ninto. Okay, let's do it. So let's assume in a\nduopoly and there's a lot of assumptions here so\njust follow along with me that if we wanted to drive them out of\nthe market, we would be interested in lowering the price,\nbut we actually want them out entirely. So\nI want you to tell me if we get them out of the market,\nwhere do we need to price and what profit do we get\nin that new situation versus where we are today. Okay and can we assume that\nthey are looking at this, this needs to be a profitable venture for\nthe competitor, or you know instead of like they might subsidize this for other\nbusiness reasons. Yeah, fair question. Let's assume that once\nthey start losing money they would be out of the market.\nOkay so we can assume that they would they would start losing money if the\nprice went down to a dollar forty, so I'm gonna,\ncan I take a minute to structure it around that assumption? Sounds good. Okay. As you're going through this why don't\nyou walk me through what you're doing on your paper.\nOkay. So I'm putting together an equation\nfor profitability. Okay. So which I've used here is margin,\nso m for margin to indicate that. So the\nequation would be what is the price, and then\nminus the cost and then times volume there, and\nyou know cost would be you know sum of,\nso if we break cost out then it would be and we'll see what we can how we can\nsimplify this in a second but, if this is price per unit\nminus the variable cost. Variable cost, and then \nthat's times volume and then... Great, let's assume that\nfixed cost is the same between them. Yeah. So you can remove that from the \nequation. Okay right. So then you know we're talking about \nthe price change here, and so we're talking about going from today... So today we make you know so two dollars\nminus 120, so we make 80 cents on every needle. Okay.\nAnd in the future state maybe a dollar forty we would make 20 cents on every needle.\nSo this is going so our our marginal profit is going to\ndecrease by it's going to drop by 25, well it will go to 25 percent of what it\nis today. Great. But our volume if we assume that we're gonna take the\nwhole market which, is it safe to assume that we have fifty\npercent of the market today? We don't actually, we\nhave more, we have seventy percent. Okay okay, so if we have seventy\npercent of the market today, which is two million\nand we're going to a hundred percent of the market,\nthen we would calculate that which... So 70% is - the 200 million is the total\nmarket - so we have 70% of the 200 million. Okay.\nSo we have 70% of the 200 million so we'll be going to 100%\nso that is 200 million. So if we calculate 70% of the 200 million\nis what we have today, so today this is the volume we're\ntalking about. Today we have 140 million units and\nthat will be going to 200 million. And so then if we're talking about and so you said what's the new price was\none of the questions. New profit. And so a new price would be $1.40 and\nthen so moving on to the new profit, so then\ntoday we're making 80 cents and we're selling 140 million of those\nand then in the future state we'll be making 20 cents\nand selling 200 million of those. Let me ask one more\nquestion. Yeah. In the future will there be a 200 million in the market? You're right, there is a five percent\ndecline in the market, so we'll have to deduct this from, so that\nwill be 190 million. So that's... well let's see. 28, so 140 minus 28\nis 112\nmillion. Okay. And this is dollars that we're making today, roughly\nhow much we're making today. Pretty nice huh.\nYeah and then the future state, 190 times 20 cents that we're making and so\nthat is 38 million. Let me just make sure that\nthis is right math here. I think that is roughly right.\nYeah looks good to me. So yeah our new our new profit would be\n38 million. Okay, what do you think about that?\nSo that's about a third of what we were making today.\nThe and so I'm just thinking through the\nwell what I want to compare it to is what is the profit if we did nothing. So that means if we assume\nboth we'll both lose five percent in the\nmarket. Yeah. Then so I'd take \nso I'd take the 80 cents and multiply it by\n140, minus that five percent so the 95 percent.\nJust take five percent off of the 112, how about that.\nThat works better. And so that would be you know we're\ntalking about five or six million off of that. Okay. And\nso in a do-nothing\nscenario we would make you know let's say 106 million, assuming\nthat the competitor also did nothing. Okay, so what should\nwe do? Well I think from a profitability\nstandpoint we would we would not want to do a price war with\nthem. Okay, I would agree. Yeah. What else can we do? So\nif we're trying to we're you know we're only\ntrying to make up about six million dollars here,\nwhich if we think about our reducing our variable costs,  so if we're selling it's we have we're selling 140 million\nunits today, so then I would want to know is how\nfar would we have to reduce our cost in order to hit the 112 million. Great. Should I go ahead and do that? I'm\ninterested if there are other options too, before we calculate that one, tell me\nif there's other choices that we have. So we talked about price and that\ndoesn't seem like a good option. We had talked about\nfixed costs and whether we can change that, it sounds\nlike we both have the same fixed costs there,\neven though they're choosing a dramatically different way of sourcing\nthe product so it doesn't seem like that's\nlike there's an alternative that's much cheaper from that standpoint. From a volume standpoint, you know, if the market is shrinking\nby five percent does it have to shrink equally across\nboth of us or and so I mean one of the places where I\ngo with it is are there certain\ncustomer segments that we work with or that will not be as\naffected by this that we could focus on or that we can\ndouble down on so that five percent is being lost\nwith the competitor versus us. I like the way you think, what else? I'm not sure. Could we raise our price? Yeah we could. If we raised our price, we\nmight expect that we might lose some market share, so it would have to be a balance between those two of how much market\nshare we would expect to lose, and if there's\nonly two choices and both are well established players,\nneedle needer and the other, then I would worry and if right now and\nhistorically we've been pricing them at the at the same, I would worry that if\nthere was all of a sudden a price difference that it would\nbe an easy switch to the others and I mean that thing\nI'm thinking about from a customer standpoint is like what is the\ncost of switching for medical needles.\nI don't I wouldn't guess that there's a ton of\nmedical equipment that is needle specific in the sense of like oh\nwe need to have these needles because we have this other equipment that is based\non that, so my guess is that it wouldn't be that\nthe cost of switching for a customer would not be huge and so that\nif there was a price difference they would go with the lower price especially\nif they knew that the other player was a big\nestablished player as well. So I would be hesitant to do that,\nunless we're talking about also the option of\ntrying to think about how to expand the market,\nWhich I don't know if that's kind of within the... Anything's within the scope.\nAre there areas where you could think about expanding that market where it's\nnot currently being utilized or at the frequency. But another,\nI wonder if there's other ways of like bundling\nwhere and maybe that's a way to gain market\nshare too, if if we're like oh we'll sell you packs of, I don't know\nwhat the packs would be, say a thousand and because it comes in a thousand,\nwe'd have to understand what what would be of value to the customer but if we could\nsell it to sell them a thousand, just as an example,\nat a lower price per unit, but in doing so gain\nmarket share then that might be a way of doing it, so there might be\nsome creative ways of bundling or packaging it. Great. That could be interesting. I think I'm ready for a\nfinal recommendation. We've thought about a lot of things,\ntell me what you would do in light of the changes that are happening\nin needle needers market. So I mean, the first thing I would look at\nis whether we can easily reduce the cost. I think my guess is that since our cost is lower than the\ncompetitors that there maybe hasn't been a ton of pressure internally to keep\ncosts low because it already felt like it was\nlow and we're making more than the competitor.\nSo my sense is that there probably would be some opportunities there\nbased on that. So I would look there first and then\nand if that doesn't prove fruitful, then I would look\noutside to understand the customers more and if there's opportunities to either\nexpand the market or to add more value to them in a way that\nwould allow you to gain market share. Great, any next steps that you'd pursue?\nSo I would do a cost analysis around the variable costs and\nunderstand what the different line items are\nthere and maybe if there's, from what I think you said, needle needer\nproduces in-house, and so if they have different\nmanufacturing locations there might be a relative cost\npositioning analysis where you can see kind of what's the best in practice\nacross our different locations and understand\nyou know if we can duplicate those savings across the rest of the\ncompany. Great. Okay, relax. All right. All right,\nso do you want to give yourself feedback or do you want me to do it first?\nYou know how sometimes you get through a case you kind of notice as you're doing\nsomething that you want to call out. I think \nthe biggest thing in terms of that is getting a little \ntunnel vision around around the framework and and not\nthinking more broadly about what some of those opportunities are until you\npushed me a bit. And so I think that that felt like\nthe biggest thing of being more \nopen-minded, you know even at that point. Cool. Yeah.\nWell, overall I thought you did a good job, which is why I didn't make you do\nbonus math. You didn't have any math errors, there\nweren't any issues, otherwise we could have done some extra math, I would have\ngiven you a second chance with that, but I will poke on a couple of things. So,\nfirst of all I thought your opening was really good.\nI thought that you had a pretty confident grasp of the subject, you\ndidn't seem afraid of the problem, you didn't seem nervous,\nyour clarifying questions were specifically intended to reduce\nthe complexity of the problem which I always love to see, when people want to\nadd in extra analysis, I always get worried about that.\nSo for example you asked, can we assume that this has already changed, or\nis this the steady state, so rather than saying you know, hey could we\nlook at this in three different phases, you were trying to say can we just look\nat this once and figure out a simple way? So I really liked that and\nI thought that that was an important nuance at the beginning of the case. The\nfact that your hypothesis was reducing the price at the end of\nyour structure, I'd want you to just call that out directly, especially in a BCG\ncase, because you're going to be now testing that\nhypothesis so it's going to be incredibly important.\nAnd just for your structure. Your structure, I didn't time it. We'll look\nback at the video and the video will actually have the timing on there,\nbut my guess is that you took too little time and you could have actually built\nout your structure in a more robust way to get away from that tunnel vision that\nyou had inside the case. So, if you had taken the full two minutes\nand you had built the second level that you verbalized\non paper, I think we could have referred back to that throughout the case\na little bit better. Yeah, makes sense. And then as we went through\nthe data I was a little surprised when you asked for the competitor data first\nand I was worried that you weren't going to ask for ours, you\nyou got the competitor data after that and one thing that you did really well\nthere that was you did a few times but it was\ninconsistent throughout the case, is that you\ngave me commentary as you were receiving the data, or as you were coming up with\ninsight so there you said, I really like the fact that we're lower\nthan the competitor this puts us in a good cost position to\nstart with, and so starting with and layering on those kind\nof insights were really valuable. And there were a couple of other times\nthat you didn't do it that I was looking for that a little bit more, so\nfor example, when we said you kind of said, hey you know we\nare going from 80 to 20, we're going to divide it to 25%, and then\nif you look at the numbers from 70% up to 100%,\nor really effectively up to 95% of the market,\nthere's no way before you do any calculations that that's going to outweigh\nthat decrease, and I think you knew that but you didn't say anything about it.\nRight, so you kind of were going through the mechanics to prove out something\nthat you already knew and you could have just impressed me by\nby saying what you knew in the first place. Yeah.\nThe final piece is around the creativity. So I asked you at the end,\nwhat else can we do? The answer to this is no, we don't do a price war. Bad\nidea. Yeah. But then with all the other things you started out with again\none idea, but that's where the tunnel vision kind of came in, so\nI would recommend that you write down some of your ideas, because I could tell\nthat you couldn't remember when we got up to about three, which ones\nyou'd already said and which ones you hadn't said, and it was a little\ndifficult to go sideways or deeper or beyond the\nthat level. You stuck with me, you had a great attitude about it so that was\nfine, but I would have loved to have seen a\nlittle bit more detail around some of those creative points. Yeah. And\njust to see you keep pushing on some of the ideas, how it could be\npossible or what would be feasible. Your final conclusion was really good,\nyou just didn't say next steps so always I would say that, but other than\nthat, I think the main things were just building out that structure to be more\nrobust, because in the BCG case you're gonna have to follow it more,\nand then in that creativity really chronicling exactly what you're doing.\nAll right. Thanks again for going through the case with me. Absolutely."}]
