Supply chains have been tested in ways they never have been before and, yes, there have been pileups, shortages and other snafus. By and large, though, companies have figured it out and kept moving, at times under impossible circumstances.\n\nShares of Inc. fell on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal reported the company would deliver only 50 million doses of its vaccine this year, half as many as initially targeted, because of supply-chain logjams. It took longer than expected to source the necessary raw materials in large quantities, said, while also noting that its clinical trial of the vaccine concluded later than first planned. The company has been indicating for weeks that the initial rollout would be scaled back, based on November news releases, but given current anxiety levels and the consequences of each passing day of the pandemic, this headline understandably put people on edge. I actually found it encouraging in a way.\n\nObviously, we would all like to see a vaccine distributed in as many doses as possible, as quickly as possible. But considering pharmaceutical companies typically wait to set up supply chains and factory lines until after a vaccine is approved, the fact that was able to cobble together the infrastructure to deliver any vaccines at all this year is an incredible feat. Not to mention, neither Pfizer nor any other drugmaker has ever developed a vaccine on this scale using messenger RNA technology that instructs the body\u2019s cells to create virus proteins. On Friday, BioNTech SE, Pfizer\u2019s partner on the vaccine, said the companies had already made most of the 50 million doses, a testament to the manufacturing prowess of its supply chain. The companies expect to make up this year\u2019s shortfall \u2014 relative to initial targets \u2014 as production of the vaccine ramps up, and are on track to distribute at least 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\n\nThe government is aiming for Pfizer to begin shipping the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Vice President Mike Pence and Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a press conference this week. Pfizer will do so directly with FedEx Corp. as part of the Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate distribution of vaccines. FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc., which historically has operated a bigger pharmaceutical shipping business, will also play a key role in the rollout. The news this week that UPS is limiting pickups at certain retailers to ease congestion should be viewed in that context.\n\nLogistics data-analytics company ShipMatrix estimates a surplus of 7 million packages per day this peak season relative to the actual capacity of the parcel-delivery industry. That\u2019s before factoring in vaccine shipments, which will inevitably displace some e-commerce orders. UPS\u2019s efforts to meter the flow of boxes into its network therefore isn't a flaw in the system; it\u2019s a feature and a reflection of the company\u2019s billions of dollars of investments in automation and software to help it more profitably handle the deluge of e-commerce shipments. Even with all of the demands on their networks right now from the pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce orders, UPS and FedEx are handling this peak season amazingly well so far. For the third week of November, FedEx delivered 96.6% of its packages on time, while UPS delivered 96.9%, according to Satish Jindel, president and founder of ShipMatrix. That should instill some confidence in their ability to get vaccines from point A to point B.\n\nUPS and FedEx are only one part of the logistics equation, though. Much of the final legwork will fall to pharmacies, whose trained medical professionals will be responsible for poking millions of arms with the vaccine, including the first wave of recipients at long-term care facilities. Thankfully, this is something they have experience with. So far this year, CVS Health Corp. has held flu-shot clinics at more than 8,000 long-term care facilities across the country, Chris Cox, a senior vice president at the company and its liaison to Warp Speed, said in an interview. There are unique features to the vaccines under development, but CVS is drawing on this know-how.\n\nThe company will ultimately administer shots at more than 30,000 elder-care facilities as part of a program coordinated by the U. S. government. CVS has selected about 1,000 of its existing pharmacies (which were chosen based on their geographical proximity to long-term care facilities) to serve as hubs for vaccine warehousing, Cox said. CVS\u2019s past experience with administering vaccinations means it already has certain cold-storage infrastructure in place, a must for the leading candidates. CVS will transport the shots from the hubs using specially-made cooling containers manufactured by AeroSafe Global.\n\nOnce the vaccine is more widely available, CVS will link its vaccine inventory management system with its software that tracks patient appointments to ensure that each individual gets two doses of the same vaccine, he said. You wouldn\u2019t want to get one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a second of Moderna Inc.\u2019s, for example. CVS will use the same messaging system it deploys for prescription pick-up reminders to prompt customers to come back for their second shot. These are the kinds of things the average person isn\u2019t thinking about right now, but these little logistical details matter a great deal.\n\nThis is not to say the back-end preparation for a vaccine rollout has been an easy process. Raw-material suppliers, logistics companies and pharmacies have had to come up with comprehensive plans despite a myriad of uncertainties, including but not limited to: knowing which, if any, of the vaccines under consideration might ultimately be approved; adjusting to shifting perspectives on who should receive inoculations first; managing through a patchwork of different plans, budgets and launch dates by the 50 individual states; and ensuring their own workers are protected during this process. There may yet be hiccups and snags, but I for one am comforted by the degree to which the private sector is on top of this process. These companies have a plan and in many ways are playing to their strengths and existing infrastructure.\n\nStuck on the Runway\n\nOne group that's eagerly cheering on the vaccine news is the aerospace sector. Ryanair Holdings Plc is so optimistic that mass inoculations will drive a travel rebound that it was willing to order 75 more of Boeing Co.\u2019s embattled 737 Max jets. It\u2019s the largest firm order for the Max since December of 2018, according to Bloomberg News. Earlier that year, the Max suffered the first of two fatal crashes that would eventually prompt a 20-month grounding. While Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary has a reputation as a hard bargainer and likely got the Max at a significant discount given its woes, he chose to characterize the price reduction as \u201cmodest\u201d and focused on the fuel-efficiency benefits. If nothing else, it was a major PR victory for Boeing, which has been dogged with questions about the future profitability of the Max program.\n\nHowever confident aerospace executives are about the post-vaccine future, they still have to deal with the worsening pandemic now. Boeing itself offered a stark reminder of that this week, with Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith telling a Credit Suisse Group AG conference on Friday that the company is planning to further trim output of its 787 Dreamliner and is considering an equity sale to help mitigate the heavy debt load it took on during the crisis. While Boeing would love the Ryanair order to be the first of many, even the strongest U. S. airlines are facing fresh turmoil. Delta Air Lines Inc. this week warned it could burn more cash than previously expected this quarter (as much as $14 million per day) and said demand had taken a hit amid the rising case count across the U. S.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co. sharply expanded the number of employees that may be affected by its first-ever forced furlough. In total, more than 7,000 jobs are at risk if the carrier and labor unions can\u2019t agree on a plan to cut $500 million of costs. On the bright side, a bipartisan stimulus bill that includes fresh aid for the airline sector appears to be gaining traction.\n\nDeals, Activists and Corporate Governance\n\nFedEx Corp. agreed to buy ShopRunner, a member-based e-commerce service that provides free shipping and returns for more than 100 brands including Neiman Marcus and American Eagle. The deal will help further embed FedEx into the e-commerce process and is a particularly notable tie-up in the wake of the company\u2019s falling-out with Amazon.com Inc. FedEx has tried to position itself as an anti-Amazon ally for other e-commerce retailers, including Walmart Inc. Terms weren\u2019t released, but FedEx says the purchase should close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Elsewhere in e-commerce deals, private equity firms continue to gobble up warehouse real estate. Blackstone Group Inc., a big player in this corner of the market, acquired 13 properties located mainly in California, northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley from Iron Mountain Inc. The price tag was $358 million. KKR & Co., meanwhile, is reportedly nearing an $800 million purchase of a portfolio of warehouses in markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Baltimore.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. announced this week that it was downgrading its lofty partnership agreement with electrical-vehicle startup Nikola Corp. to what is essentially a glorified supplier contract. GM will supply the Hydrotec fuel-cell system to Nikola\u2019s commercial semi-trucks at \u201ccost plus\u201d \u2014 meaning the startup will reimburse it for costs incurred as well as a specified profit. Gone is the production agreement for Nikola\u2019s Badger pickup truck, a program that now appears to be defunct. Also gone is GM\u2019s willingness to be compensated for its services in Nikola stock. After a rough few months for Nikola that included accusations of deception by a short-seller (denied by the company) and the departure of founder Trevor Milton as executive chairman, GM would prefer cold hard cash. The obvious question is, if GM doesn\u2019t want Nikola stock, why would anyone else? The shares fell more than 30% this week. My colleague Tim O\u2019Brien calls for more explanation from GM on how the company could so misjudge Nikola\u2019s prospects. Personally, I continue to believe that GM didn\u2019t misjudge Nikola, but rather the stock market. Investors are much less willing to award companies that lack revenue or proven technology with premium valuations than they were just a few short months ago. And hey, GM still got out while the getting was good. Elsewhere in bad news for electrical-vehicle startups, shares of Workhorse Group Inc. also plummeted this week after reports that the U. S. Postal Service further delayed a key contract for new mail trucks.\n\nXPO Logistics Inc. is moving ahead with a breakup. The $11 billion company will spin off its contract logistics businesses, leaving behind a provider of services for shippers who don't need a full truck to carry their freight. This completes the strategic review process XPO announced in January; an attempted sale of its European supply-chain business reportedly stalled after Blackstone dropped out of the bidding over valuation disagreements. XPO says the split will help each business hone its customer and technology focus, attract better talent and operate with lower debt profiles. If there was a generic \u201cbreakup logic\u201d you could buy right off the shelf, that would be it. The split marks a turning point for a company that was built via consolidation of a fragmented industry. That being said, the market is happy: XPO shares climbed on the news to a fresh record. \u201cIt is hard to argue that thesis creep has not occurred, but one thing has not changed and that is the company\u2019s commitment to maximize shareholder value,\u201d Cowen analyst Jason Seidl wrote in a note. He also questions whether this breakup might offer an eventual exit strategy for XPO CEO Brad Jacobs, a serial entrepreneur. Elsewhere in logistics, Transfix, a startup that operates a freight marketplace, is reportedly in talks to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm, Tuscan Holdings Corp. II.\n\nEaton Corp. has lured away W. W. Grainger Inc. CFO Thomas Okray, who will join the electrical equipment company in the same role starting in April. Current Eaton CFO Rick Fearon will leave big shoes to fill upon his retirement, and this job will bring unique challenges to Okray, RBC analyst Deane Dray wrote in a report. He points out that Eaton\u2019s Irish domicile gives it a different tax profile than what Okray is used to at Grainger, while the company\u2019s more global business and appetite for M&A will also be a change. That being said, Dray thinks Okray is up for the job.\n\nGrab Bag. It appears dealmakers and regulators were busy over the holiday weekend. GardaWorld increased its hostile offer for British security provider G4S Plc to 235 pence-a-share ($4.9 billion) and lowered the investor acceptance threshold to 50% plus one share. Garda says this is its final offer, unless G4S gets a bid from someone else, which feels like a possibility as G4S said Thursday that it continues to hold talks with Allied Universal. My colleague Chris Hughes writes that Garda squandered an opportunity by not raising its bid more significantly earlier. CSX Corp. inked an agreement to buy New England carrier Pan Am Railways. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow says CSX should be able to lower Pan Am\u2019s operating ratio to around 60% from an estimated 80% to 85% currently (a lower number here is good). And lastly, Alstom SA said it had finally received all regulatory approvals to acquire Bombardier Inc.\u2019s rail business. This is somewhat ironic because Bombardier also this week named Bart Demosky its new CFO and Demosky has had a long career in \u2026 the rail industry."}, {"title": "IoT: Meeting Global Market Demands During Supply Chain Shortages", "link": "https://www.iotforall.com/supply-chains-are-shorter-but-the-iot-will-help-meet-global-market-demands", "date": "2020-12-04 13:00:48+00:00", "authors": "['Guest Writer', 'Hima Mukkamala', 'Iot For All', 'Joe Biron', 'Stefan Pircalabu']", "keywords": "['market', 'supply', 'labels', 'business', 'global', 'companies', 'chain', 'shortages', 'demands', 'products', 'meeting', 'data', 'meet', 'iot']", "summary": "Shortages can be caused by production line stoppages and supply chain inefficiencies due to a lack of insight.\nBefore COVID-19, IoT brought together many parts of the supply chain to create a single product.\nIf there is a problem with the supply chain for just one of these parts, the creation of an entire fleet of airliners can be held up.\nPhil Skipper, head of business development at global IoT leader Vodafone Business believes that shortening the supply chain could allow smaller companies to bring their products to market faster.\nAmid the health crisis, we can expect more companies to meet global market demands while focusing on digital transformation to function in the new economic world order.", "text": "The coronavirus pandemic strained countries\u2019 supply lines, forcing them to scramble to get critical supplies in. That was perhaps most evident in areas like sourcing personal protective equipment (PPE), a critical component of infection control strategies in healthcare settings. In most cases, domestic supply chains weren\u2019t able to scale to meet domestic needs, and the sudden increase in demand also showed international suppliers weren\u2019t always as reliable as might be expected.\n\nShortages can be caused by production line stoppages and supply chain inefficiencies due to a lack of insight. The health crisis illuminated something we already knew: insights based on IoT data have a key role in ensuring supply chain activities are anchored on trusted insights driving efficiency and responsiveness in times of crisis.\n\nBut while it seems an irrefutable fact that logistics companies should deploy IoT technology as fast as possible, those deployments must be carefully managed. Just before the pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) Business Index 2020, a survey and report launched by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), reported that 28 percent of executives believed supply chain management and logistics benefited more from IoT enhancements than any other part of their business. We expect this percentage will rise, as the current projections for the global logistics market indicate growth of approximately 18 percent by 2021. The industry is already at the forefront of meeting the growing demand for PPE and finding innovative ways to distribute the supply of other essential commodities by using IoT.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the EIU report showed that the industrial sector was also benefiting from early IoT adoption, and currently, it is well-positioned to help meet consumer demand. Although global economic activity has decreased, the deployment of IoT-empowered automation technologies is increasing: Nearly half of the business leaders are accelerating plans to automate their businesses.\n\nAs the global business community grapples with questions over how to avoid supply chain bottlenecks, it\u2019s worth examining some of the IoT-empowered tools companies are using to adopt new technologies and platforms and how these businesses are using precise and reliable data to build integrity across supply chains.\n\nShortening of the Supply Chain\n\nSupply chains are dizzyingly complex and fragmented. All points along the chain require tremendous data management efforts \u2014 from fielding customer demand and working with raw material suppliers to producing components, order requests, and management and delivery service.\n\nBefore COVID-19, IoT brought together many parts of the supply chain to create a single product. For example, the world\u2019s largest passenger airliner, the Airbus A380, contains 4 million parts produced by 1,500 companies from 30 countries. If there is a problem with the supply chain for just one of these parts, the creation of an entire fleet of airliners can be held up.\n\nAs the economy shifts toward more local production and distribution markets, the solution to fragmentation will need to lean toward creating simpler, more transparent supply chains rather than simply decreasing the number of parts per product.\n\nPhil Skipper, head of business development at global IoT leader Vodafone Business believes that shortening the supply chain could allow smaller companies to bring their products to market faster. In contrast, larger enterprises will need to focus more on security and scale to manage countless streams of digital data to get real business outcomes. A shorter supply chain, says Skipper, allows companies to \u201crestructure [their] process, but it also gives more control to execute [their plans] faster and more consistently.\u201d\n\nSmart Labels Mitigate Supply Chain Challenges\n\nEven as more production goes local, global trade is necessary. Yet all too often, kinks along the supply chain prevent products from ever reaching markets.\n\nGlobally, billions of dollars worth of pharmaceutical products are shipped at improper temperatures. In contrast, other products either don\u2019t arrive at their destinations until their use-by dates have expired or are not as-promised by suppliers. These problems aren\u2019t just expensive for companies \u2014 they can be life-threatening for people reliant on the drugs.\n\nSmart labels look just like normal adhesive postal labels. Still, their iSIM technology, consisting of a SIM, battery, antenna, microprocessor, and modem all integrated into a single chip, is specifically designed for low-power IoT devices. These smart labels connect via public mobile networks and provide continuous service from its power source. They allow companies to monitor products in real-time through the supply chain and take action when there is a problem. If, for example, a sudden change in temperature occurs, a notification is sent that triggers an alert to take corrective action or highlight an area for process improvement. Also, the smart labels can\u2019t be removed from products without inhibiting their functionality, making them more tamper-proof, thereby ensuring the legitimacy of shipments.\n\nAutomation and Robotics Help Meet Customer Demand\n\nIn addition to creating \u2018smart\u2019 products that use data to alert companies to real-time problems in the supply chain, declining revenues due to the coronavirus crisis are forcing companies to accelerate investments in automation and robotics.\n\nEven before the onset of the current pandemic, robots were already used to speed up production in warehouses operated by major companies. Amid the health crisis, venture capitalists have fueled this growth by injecting $36 million into AI firm Brain Corp. to increase automation in areas of the logistics industry that are struggling to meet consumer demand and handle human labor shortages. As more companies lean into automation, we can expect safer, more resilient supply chains.\n\nChange Won\u2019t Happen Overnight\n\nFor some years now, businesses have been looking at gaining a competitive advantage on process optimization, greater automation, and better use of data \u2014 collectively known as digital transformation. COVID-19 is simply accelerating these plans.\n\nAmid the health crisis, we can expect more companies to meet global market demands while focusing on digital transformation to function in the new economic world order."}, {"title": "Talent Management For a Post\u2010COVID\u201019 Supply Chain\u2014The Critical Role for Managers", "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbl.12266", "date": "None", "authors": "['Remko Van Hoek', 'University Of Arkansas', 'Brian Gibson', 'Auburn University', 'Mark Johnson', 'University Of Warwick', 'Corresponding Author', 'Gibson', 'Kerr', 'Fisher']", "keywords": "['chainthe', 'postcovid19', 'supply', 'learning', 'university', 'managers', 'future', 'chain', 'et', 'research', 'management', 'critical', 'industry', 'work', 'role', 'talent']", "summary": "We hope that future research will also address other relevant themes as detailed below.\nWhat they do not cover is the role of supply chain leaders and managers in HRM.\nThis raises the question what the role of SCM executive and managers is in HRM is and how they can help address skill and volume challenges to future\u2010proof the supply chain?\nRather it would be the cruciality of supply chain manager\u2019s efforts to cope with supply chain challenges faced by companies (van Hoek, 2020a , 2020b ).\nWhat is worrisome in that context that there is a growing shortage of supply chain talent (McKinnon et al, 2017 ).", "text": "In this special topic forum, we aimed to help address these challenges and gaps. We did not necessarily receive as many submissions as we had hoped to and because we upheld the rigor and resulting low acceptance rate of the Journal of Business Logistics we ended up with only 2 papers in the STF. But these papers address key themes helping us make progress. We hope that future research will also address other relevant themes as detailed below.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a surprising shortage of research on human resource management (HRM) in SCM (Hohenstein et al, 2014 ). Comprehensive literature reviews of SCM research on HRM (Hohenstein et al 2014 ; Lutz and Birou 2013 ) focus on HRM essential activities and techniques such as recruiting, training, and education. What they do not cover is the role of supply chain leaders and managers in HRM. Yet, McCarter et al ( 2005 ) conclude that there is a fair amount of \u201clip service\u201d being paid about the importance of people in industry and that there are lots of shortfalls in talent development. This raises the question what the role of SCM executive and managers is in HRM is and how they can help address skill and volume challenges to future\u2010proof the supply chain?\n\nThe SCM field tends to be more focused on the \u201cwhat\u201d of SCM than on the \u201chow.\u201d Yet the human equation in achieving SCM success is undeniably large (van Hoek et al, 2002 ; Meyers et al 2004 ). If the current pandemic environment teaches us one thing, it would not necessarily be that supply chains need improvement. Rather it would be the cruciality of supply chain manager\u2019s efforts to cope with supply chain challenges faced by companies (van Hoek, 2020a , 2020b ). What is worrisome in that context that there is a growing shortage of supply chain talent (McKinnon et al, 2017 ). Consultancy firm Deloitte found that <50% of respondents to a survey indicated that their team\u2019s skills and capabilities are sufficient to deliver procurement strategies. 1 So we might face a volume and a skill challenge and the current environment may only make this a greater concern for managers.\n\nKEY THEMES AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES\n\nTable 1 provides overview and explanation of themes and further research opportunities within those themes and the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on this theme.\n\nTable 1. Supply chain talent management research themes and opportunities and impact of COVID\u201019 Theme Explanation Selected further research opportunities Selected (post)COVID\u201019 implications EI In managing tech\u2010savy and modern supply chain workforce emotional intelligence of managers impact retention, engagement, and service outcomes Collaboration with managers in experiments EI only more crucial for coping with pandemic events and for achieving resilience Digitization Digital technologies impact the role of executives but in a nuanced way; they may complement, overtake, and not impact roles Impact of cultural differences Strategies for managers to digitize Behavioral approaches to digitization in the supply chain Digitization, widely called for to improve resilience, may be long time horizon. Future of work in supply chains Industry 4.0 will augment work, create new roles, and reduce the need for other roles. Lifelong learning expected to be essential Growing importance of talent management in the supply chain and need for executives to create learning opportunities and make failure safe COVID\u201019 is growing the need for a move to industry 4.0 but the question is if managers will \u201crevert0020back\u201d or accelerate the transformation after the pandemic University education model The delivery model may need to change to support lifelong learning Rebalancing product portfolio, more company engagement and change of the HRM model toward adjunct faculty and faculty with industry experience COVID\u201019 engagement provides a great stepping stone to experiment the education delivery model University research model In order to support lifelong learning product development research may become more collaborative with managers How to engage managers in research to enable their learning and how to connect research with industry learning needs more COVID\u201019 presents the perfect opportunity for event\u2010based risk research and manager engaged research and learning\n\nTheme 1\u2014The role of emotional intelligence in supply chain talent management Ralston et al study the importance of emotional intelligence of supply chain managers in managing the modern workforce of technology savy and digital enabled staff. They find that managers possessing higher levels of emotional intelligence are better equipped to build positive working conditions, increase retention of employees, and achieve more positive service outcomes for external customers. They also offer practical suggestions for managers to capture the \u201cEI advantage\u201d in the competitive labor market. The extension of this research called for in the paper includes collaborative work with managers to conduct experiments. It can be assumed that in the (post\u2010)pandemic environment EI will only gain importance. The extension Ralston et al\u2019s findings would lead to the assumption that the ability to support employees through stressful and challenging periods and major change initiatives can enhance resilience widely called for. Furthermore, as the next themes will consider digitization and the future of work will likely only make EI more important, instead of less important.\n\nTheme 2\u2014The role of digitization Wehrle et al find that digital technology impacts SCM executive\u2019 roles and HRM in supportive, intensifying and changing ways. In some areas, technology may take over some of the SCM executive role, in others it may complement and in others there are key roles that squarely remain with the SCM executive. What emerges is a nuance view on the role of technology as an enabler and contributor to progress that does not excuse managers from needing to engage in HRM. Future research called for by the authors include the consideration of cultural differences between countries and continents as well as the need for deriving strategies for managers to move toward a digitized supply chain. These suggestions return us to behavioral and managerial aspects such as those highlighted in theme 1. Additionally, the fact that the study shows a very long time horizon for digitization efforts implies that while digitization is widely called for to improve resilience in the (post)COVID\u201019 supply chain the actual achievement of those capabilities.\n\nTheme 3\u2014Talent management for the future of work in industry 4.0 supply chains Building upon the theme of digitization, industry 4.0 is widely expected to impact the future of work in supply chains. The WEF points at the growing relevance of lifelong learning and the augmentation of jobs with industry 4.0 capabilities. While certain roles are expected to disappear, other will change and certain new roles will be created (WEF, 2018). If the future of work implies change, triggering a need to continue to learn, then the focus on talent management only becomes more important. Executives will have to create learning opportunities and make failure safe. It will also mean that executives will have to develop a \u201clearning style\u201d to managing; they will not know all the future of work holds but with their teams they can work together to create the future of work. COVID\u201019 may have provided additional impetus for industry 4.0. With the move to working from home and social distancing, technological augmentation has become increasingly valuable and managers may have \u201cjumped\u201d the learning curve. Question will be to what degree managers will be tempted to revert back to \u201cold ways\u201d or if they will find themselves building upon new capabilities and skills, accelerating the transformation.\n\nTheme 4\u2014Changing the university education model While plenty of studies consider the role of curricula design and university programs (Wu 2007; Lutz and Birou, 2013), what is the role of executives in university program development and adoption? Gibson et al (2016) point at the value of collaboration between industry and university in learning and van Hoek et al (2011) point at the value of guest lecturing. What else can executive do to inform course design and development? And how does the university delivery model need to change for the future for lifelong learning and to address skill gaps among supply chain personnel? There are commoditization tendencies on traditional university programs ($1/day online programs) and competitive challenges from companies self\u2010organizing semiuniversities to educate their personnel. So in order for universities to support lifelong learning in modern supply chains, the education delivery model likely needs some new SKU\u2019s and a rebalancing of massive standardized undergrad and grad programs with some more company\u2010engaged products and offerings that establish long\u2010term and ongoing learning opportunities, not just 1\u20134 years programs. Additionally, this may accelerate changes in the university HRM model. Adjunct faculty, teaching assistants, and PhD candidates have been used as \u201csurrogates\u201d for teaching prepackaged courses rolled out like a mass produced product. Executive education has traditional received more of a customized approach with the best faculty engaging (and dictating high margin pricing). As we move toward lifelong learning and commoditization of university programs, mass customization of programs, including postgraduate programs, may become crucial, as may relationships with corporations.

The kits consist of modules that can be adapted to fit different needs, but the packaging of the modules is identical, so every recipient can look at the kit's instructions and identify everything rapidly, says Hedman.\n\nSimilarly, the drug supply chain faces many threats, and responses to those threats may contain certain core elements but cannot all be the same, says Craig Kennedy, senior vice president of global supply chain management at Merck. (The latest CIDRAP \"Viewpoint\" report points out nine root causes of drug shortages.)\n\nHeather Wall, chief commercial officer of Civica Rx, immediately agreed. \"We need redundancy and strategic stockpiles and also a look at the supply chain diversity,\" she said. \"Some of them might not make sense for redundancy, and many of them completely make sense. But that can't be the only solution.\"\n\nJust as important, once the solution is settled upon, it has to be followed through with the same methodical precision that the WHO kit shows in its packaging. Stephen Schondelmeyer, PharmD, PhD, RDSP co-principal investigator, relayed examples of hospitals that received the antiviral drug remdesivir in unmarked boxes in their labs and monoclonal antibodies arriving at long-term care facilities that weren't equipped to administer them.\n\n\"You can run a marathon, but if you don't finish the last 200 yards, you don't finish the marathon,\" he says.\n\nSubstandard products, shortages among COVID-19 problems\n\nAs Michael Schiller, CISM, senior director of the Association for Health Care Resource & Materials Management, said, \"COVID-19 was the perfect storm,\" as it led to export bans, factory shutdowns, delayed transportation, and demand surges, allocation issues, and substandard and falsified (SF) products.\n\nFor instance, Pernette Bourdillon Esteve, team lead of incidents and SF medical products at the WHO, presented a timeline of COVID-19 treatments correlating with reports of SF products, with some of the latest being COVID-19 vaccinations and dexamethasone in November. Because emerging treatments and vaccines often go to high-income countries first, she predicts a shift of SF problems to these countries, which may have historically considered the problem a lower priority.\n\nHoarding and supply shortages have also made their presence known. Without widely adopted guidelines, drug cascade shortages are more likely, said Michael Ganio, PharmD, director of pharmacy practice and quality at ASHP. Additionally, standard operational items such as isopropyl alcohol, which are used for sterilizing rooms, were in short supply.\n\nOn the patient end, Suzanne Schrandt, JD, founder and CEO of patient-engagement company ExPPect, added that not only was there a lack of antimalarials for those suffering from rheumatic diseases, but the disappearance of common items like alcohol pads caused difficulties for people who self-inject treatments. (The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine was touted early in the pandemic as an effective COVID-19 treatment.)\n\nPre-positioning and preparing the process\n\nStakeholders across the supply chain dealt with disruptions due to COVID-19, but some areas had larger breakdowns because pre-positioning available products to meet upcoming demand surges can last only so long, said Hedman. When surge stock runs out, the industry relies on processes already established.\n\nCalling up another regulator to share dossier information is much easier to achieve when the relationship and the reliance already exists before an emergency, she explains. Creating rosters of emergency staff is another example, and other workshop presenters talked about areas that needed improvement such as the slow process to change transportation channels, decentralized reporting and resource pooling, and a lack of personal protective equipment research and education, such as classifications, decontamination, and reuse of respirators.\n\nThe panelists also said that manufacturers that discontinue products should have transitional regulations so market demand can be appropriately transferred, especially in the case of generics. Some suggested that agencies should even address economic issues and create more incentives for companies to stay in critical markets.\n\nTransparency needs to increase in more than one area, as well. Pharmacists need to have easier access to drug quality information at the buying stage, the experts said, and drug companies should be more transparent about what manufacturing sites they use throughout the supply chain. However, the latter is not as cut-and-dry as it may seem: Kennedy reminded the committee that transparency must be balanced with security, as some counterfeiters target facilities to steal discarded parts meant for disposal.\n\nDifferent medicine lists reflect different purposes\n\nAt least five lists of important drugs were mentioned during the workshops, which is OK, says Schondelmeyer. For example, he says, the list for stockpiling for active military would differ from the list that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would develop for natural disasters, which would likewise vary from the list needed for the American public if factories around the world were to shut down.\n\nWhile some of these lists are still in development, such as the Food and Drug Administration's Executive Order 13944 list, others have already changed policy in their respective spheres of influence. Dan Kistner, PharmD, Vizient group senior vice president of pharmacy services, says that by working off the company's list of 200-plus drugs (created in January and already updated multiple times), Vizient's private-label Novaplus program has a 6-month supply for 151 of the products.\n\nAt the WHO, the essentials medicine list (updated biannually since 1977) helps dictate what is in the inter-agency emergency health kits.\n\nAt this time, there is no published timeline for the committee's study and recommendations. The full recording of the public workshops will be available at the NAS site in the coming week."}, {"title": "Building the Cloud Supply Chain - Stord Raises $31M Series B Led by Founders Fund", "link": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/building-the-cloud-supply-chain--stord-raises-31m-series-b-led-by-founders-fund-301186764.html", "date": "None", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "['grown', 'supply', 'building', 'largest', 'founders', 'raises', 'investors', 'stord', 'cloud', 'fund', 'chain', 'series', 'massive', 'expertise', 'logistics', 'brands', 'mission', 'led']", "summary": "Stord raises a $31M Series B to build the cloud supply chain, and offer Amazon-level logistics to everyone.\nTweet thisWhereas building a traditional supply chain requires investing substantial time and money in physical infrastructure, complex legacy software, and human expertise, our cloud-supply chain is built to fundamentally abstract these complexities.\nStord provides brands a cloud-based platform that offers complex logistics services, with service levels typically only available for the largest brands, and with utility-like pay-as-you-go pricing that a brand can leverage from startup to enterprise-level scale.\nWe believe that we can democratize the heightened consumer experience that is today only available to the largest brands.\nTo fulfill this mission, we're excited to welcome Founders Fund to our journey, who has a long track-record partnering with companies to disrupt massive industries.", "text": "Stord raises a $31M Series B to build the cloud supply chain, and offer Amazon-level logistics to everyone.

In turn, that's fueled interest in localizing resources - and supporting organizations that serve populations in need.\n\nEnter the Denver-based FoodMaven. FoodMaven's goal? No more landfills of discarded food. Recover the $200 billion in lost revenue caused by wasted food each year - and give buyers and suppliers a new marketplace to sell and purchase food - before it hits the landfill.\n\nBut could FoodMaven rise to the pandemic food supply challenge? On a recent video call, Greg Lems, FoodMaven's Director of Engineering, gave me the full story.\n\nBuilding a new marketplace for selling food supply\n\nWe would all love to stop food waste in landfills. Much of the discarded food is perfectly good for human consumption. But - easier said than done. So why does food waste happen? Lems outlined three major reasons: food oversupply, imperfect-but-still-perfectly consumable food, and local food. Local? Yes, because some farmers are too small to be considered by the \"big food system.\" Can a marketplace help? Perhaps, but you better get the tech right. As Lems told me:\n\nIn order to create a marketplace for that type of product, you have to have some technology behind it. It's more than just \"Hey, let's create an app or a website.\" It's creating a fair amount of smarts around that entire chain. We have suppliers that come to us and say, \"Hey, we have over-supply food, how do we get that with you, and then get it into a marketplace?\"\n\nFoodMaven also needs the tech to reach out to restaurants and other organizations that buy food in bulk, and to do that at scale. Then there is the pricing engine. Lems:\n\nPart of our value proposition is that the food we sell, we can sell it at a discount, because it was, you know, sort of rescued. But if we don't have the prices right, nobody's going to want to buy it. So we have to be able to create algorithms, and store a tremendous amount of data about correct prices for food.\n\nWelcome to the engineer's riddle. Each piece of FoodMaven's process requires a technical underpinning - far more than their previous QuickBooks system could handle. That's why Lems joined the organization in July 2018.\n\nGetting the food sourced properly, putting it into a marketplace, and then having the right pricing around it - every piece of that has a technology component... I have a career as a software developer and technology leader; it just seemed like a super cool problem to try to solve.\n\nWhen Lems started, the tech was still adhoc:\n\nIn the beginning, startups are, from a technology standpoint - they're all spreadsheets. That's how you manage your business as a startup. Then you take the credit card out, and buy [your first] SaaS solution. That's where we were when I joined.\n\nYour tech platform must support your growth\n\nLems wanted an infrastructure that could grow with their ambitions:\n\nPart of our strategy is to start in one part of the country, in this case, Colorado, and then acquire food distributors in other markets across the United States... I just went to Dallas to get our acquisition down there cut over to our new platform.\n\nTime to think like an enterprise:\n\nAs you look at a rollout like that, how are you going to go to multiple cities, multiple markets, integrate with e-commerce systems, integrate with a warehouse management system, all that kind of stuff? Obviously, you have to look at a more enterprise-type solution. And that's what I was brought on to do.\n\nSo was Acumatica on the radar screen from the beginning? Lems explains:\n\nYes, we had a few different vendors on the radar screen - Infor was in there, as well as NetSuite. But we really liked Acumatica for its flexibility and integration capabilities.\n\nPulling in data across systems was a key criteria:\n\nWe have a lot of things we want to tie into. Like I mentioned before, data and data flow is important. We need to be able to integrate to a number of other systems... That's what we liked about Acumatica was its flexibility - and also its ability to grow and scale.\n\nFoodMaven actually began with a pilot project on Acumatica, related to community purchasing of food at the Pikes Peak Community College food bank. FoodMaven used Acumatica to manage the food inventory. That project showed Lems what he needed to see:\n\nWe said, \"Let's have an initial project with it; that way, we can see how the integration works before we do a full-on cutover. \"Anybody who's done ERP rollouts knows all sorts of horror stories of trying to do too many things at once. So we figured we'd give it a whirl this way - and it went well.\n\nFoodMaven's main Colorado business went live on Acumatica in September of 2019; they were fully operational on Acumatica well before the proverbial adversity hit the fan this spring. So what happened next?\n\nFortunately, cloud ERP enables remote working. But as Lems says, some things you do have to do in person, even when you're running on cloud tech. Example: putting stickers on warehouse boxes, inventory counts, scanner guns. He picks up the story:\n\nUnless you have a warehouse full of robots, which, like most startups, we don't, everything hit the fan... For one, as you alluded to, a lot of employees needed to be able to work from home. Acumatica, as a cloud solution, is great for that. We didn't have to get everybody on a VPN, and go through all that hassle.\n\nThe pandemic hits the fan\n\nFoodMaven's customer demand went in different directions. Restaurants shut down; retailers found their shelves bare - and needed FoodMaven more than ever. Colleges were emptied - one client source (temporarily) gone. But: hospital demand remained steady. FoodMaven was compelled to add another service: business-to-consumer sales. As Lems tells it, B2C was less of a business imperative, and more of a community obligation.\n\nWe had a number of members of our community interested in our product... That's somebody coming to you and saying, \"Here's my credit card; I want to buy some food.\" We felt the community deserved that common offering. And: it furthered our mission to try to prevent that food from going to waste. So we set it up. We still have a limited presence of a B2C, which is supported by Acumatica on the back end, so that people in our community can make purchases from us. Anybody who wants to buy fifty pounds of chicken breasts, have at it - just make sure you have a big freezer.\n\nAll in all, FoodMaven pulled through. If anything, the public interest in a sustainable food supply has gone up. I don't believe in making \"silver lining\" observations about what we've been through this year, but there was already a growing interest in local/organic food. Public interest in the food supply chain is at an all-time high. If that's a permanent pandemic effect, we'll take it. Lems:\n\nIt's something that hits home with everybody. You know, with everything that's been going on in politics recently, somebody said, \"You can watch what's happening at the national level on TV, but really, what it comes down to is: what's your mayor doing? And what's your school board doing?\" Those are the things that affect you the most. So it makes sense that people are paying attention to local - and food as part of that.\n\nAs FoodMaven presses on, what else do they want to do with Acumatica? Lems says their recent focus was customizations needed for the food industry. Now he wants to push ahead with even deeper e-commerce and warehouse management integrations. Keeping up with Acumatica's new functionality keeps Lems' team busy also:\n\nAcumatica is always coming out with new features. We've been through one major upgrade at this point, and it was great. There were a lot of really interesting things - integrations with reporting platforms, and data and analytics, which we want to dive more into as well. So we're really excited about what's kind of next.\n\nThe wrap - taking on the data and analytics challenge\n\nWe talked about where Lems wants to take FoodMaven with analytics. As DataMaven adds more metropolitan areas, more data will be pulled into Acumatica - including pricing preferences, and seasonal demand fluctuations. Lems sees all of that going into Acumatica's built-in dashboards. That provides views for the operations team, as they manage the flow of products from FoodMaven warehouses.\n\nLems' team has customized their share of Acumatica reports. That's because FoodMaven has reporting needs - beyond the typical business metrics like margin analysis. Some of their supply comes in on consignment. When that food is sold, consignment fees must be paid and accounted for. That impacts margins, and year-over-year forecasting as well. Lems:\n\nThere's a lot of reporting around operational accountability. Have we processed all of our returns for today? Have we processed anything that is maybe in like, inventory investigations - type bin or location. That gets automatically reported on, blasted out to the people who need it. They see it every night; they're held accountable to maintaining the numbers correctly that are in those reports every day.\n\nLems laid out a simple data rule:\n\nThe saying in the company is: \"If it didn't happen in Acumatica, it didn't happen.\" So the reporting that comes out of Acumatica is how we run our entire business. It's kind of the linchpin to everything.\n\nLems team is keeping busy - they just brought the Dallas business into Acumatica as of October 2020. As for the biggest benefit of the new platform, well, that depends on your role. For Lems, it's about the integration capabilities. \"Once you can integrate to a system like that, you can do pretty much anything,\" he says. For other users, it's about visibility:\n\nProbably the number one benefit is the visibility and transparency into the business. What's going on every day? Where is it going on? And where do we need to focus to meet our goals? It's that capability to see everything.\n\nBut in this most unusual year, perhaps the best thing was having a lifeline from home into the operations of the business. Lems says that Zoom was the top application for keeping employees connected - but Acumatica was a close second:\n\nAside from Zoom, it's probably the number one app that pulled everybody together during that time.\n\nFor those who have been around ERP systems a long time, that's a whole new way of thinking. I'd argue that's what ERP was supposed to be doing all along."}, {"title": "Firms Combine Logistical Capabilities to Support the NHS", "link": "https://www.supplychaindigital.com/logistics/edinburgh-join-logistical-capabilities-support-nhs", "date": "None", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "['frontline', 'combine', 'sanitiser', 'workers', 'firms', 'uk', 'edinburgh', 'palletised', 'nhs', 'capabilities', 'freight', 'services', 'group', 'support', 'palletways', 'logistical']", "summary": "Pickering\u2019s Gin at Summerhall Distillery switched its available resources during the height of the pandemic to develop and produce hand-sanitising spray to help keep frontline workers safe.\nIt\u2019s logistics partner, Palletways Edinburgh , part of Palletways \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and fastest-growing express palletised freight network, and part of Imperial Group, transported goods to the NHS, emergency services, schools and care homes across Scotland.\nSo far, the distillery has produced over 90,000 bottles of hand sanitiser for frontline services including the armed forces, care homes and pharmacies across the UK.\nVanda Roberts, general manager at Palletways Edinburgh, said: \u201cDespite the challenges, our services continued throughout the crisis.\nThe Palletways Group comprises 450+ depots and 23 hub operations, through which it provides collection and distribution services across 24 European countries, including the UK.", "text": "Pickering\u2019s Gin at Summerhall Distillery switched its available resources during the height of the pandemic to develop and produce hand-sanitising spray to help keep frontline workers safe.
