Blockchain can transform Industries | Neil Shepherd from BCG | MWC 2019 | Trubloq Launch", "channel": "Tanla Platforms Limited", "duration": "21:31", "views": 655, "published": "1 year ago", "transcript": " thank you good morning everybody so Neil Shepherd here from BCG happy to spend a bit of time with you talking about telecom and blockchain together so I've got a short presentation here we're gonna talk a little bit about getting on the same page about what blockchain is and why it's unique and what it does a little bit differently to traditional ways of storing and sharing data we're gonna talk about some of our findings in the rest of the world in terms of the different industries where we're seeing block chains start to get some traction that'll give you some idea of the momentum that we're actually seeing in the in the world just now around blockchain and we're gonna finish off with just talking a little bit about where blockchain is useful or most applicable within telecom and give a few examples to whet your appetite about why blockchain is a particularly exciting topic and created a bunch of new opportunity so without further ado I'm gonna talk a little bit about what blockchain actually is just so we're grounded on it so you can think of this the technical terms this is a shared digital ledger or distributed ledger technology you can also think of this as a database but the way it works is that you have multiple participants who all share the exactly the same copy of the database it's not like where you have islands of information within company firewalls or potentially with a regulators firewall etc you actually share the data and blockchain is great at sharing data across corporate firewalls also there's one other thing I want to talk about that you've probably heard about Bitcoin aetherium all of these other crypto currencies we're not going to talk about that at all that's just a totally different area it happens to be enabled by blockchain but really the exciting thing for enterprises is enterprise ok private blockchain I thought my voice was loud enough but not but basically enterprise private blockchain are very high-performance blockchain networks that allow a lot of the use cases that we're now talking about so I'll talk a little bit about how they work so first up the way this works and it does this in a very secure way is when there's a new transaction that is wants to be posted to the ledger it's added to what's known as a block and then it's encrypted based on not only the contents of that block but also the content of what followed before it in a chronological order and the reason this happens is that it basically checks that every entry in the database relies on every other so that you have a very secure and tamper proof way of storing the data so you have all the parties that are those nodes that we showed in the previous page actually look at this compare the the digital signature of these different blocks make sure they add up they are the same and then they vote to decide whether the block should be allowed or not and in this way you actually need a majority of the different participants in the network to actually agree before something's posted if it's valid it's added to the chain and then you go for the next so it makes it very secure so a couple of things that are very different and this is going to get into why this is a very different technology is blockchain does things in a very different way to Jewish traditional ways of storing data the first thing is you have a single version of the truth shared across all participants in the network so everybody can see the same exact data which means that it's very easy to actually do a lot more rather than have problems reconciling data which is what happens in telecom and elsewhere as well it's encrypted by default a very important point is it eliminates or can eliminate intermediaries so in many cases where you have businesses where you grunt you don't really want to trust one person with your data blockchain is an excellent solution where you can be sure that you don't have to do that the fourth thing here is that it unlocks new business models and the exciting thing here is that if you had situations where you just because you couldn't share the data in a secure and sensible way without intermediaries you're now able to create what looks in many cases like a network effect business so we'll talk about some examples like that but basically you couldn't do these before and then the final piece is and this this also gets to be quite exciting and one of the the true potentials of blockchain is it facilitates automation and the reason for this is if you actually have a secure single version of the truth that everybody agrees on already why can't you write contracts or rules we call them smart contracts that operate on that if you have the data use it and then you have automation you have immediate access to two contracts or two transactions that are approved you can be paid immediately if something is approved it's a very very powerful tool so what we have now is some examples now this map here is in a way it's a bit blinding by science but this is the evidence of what we see blockchain showing up in in terms of use cases and in industries around the world so literally we see here supply chain is a very large use case financial services I'll go through some examples here but we've mapped out many of the different use cases were seeing see tractions throughout the world and to be quite frank we couldn't probably have done this two years ago it's taken quite a while to actually identify where these spaces where blockchain has its unique advantages because this is not really a full disclosure it's not an easy technology to understand so it takes a while for this to mature now why these the use cases have shown up is because they actually leverage some of the capabilities of blockchain that we saw on a previous page they allowed transactions in a very secure way they allow sharing of data and in many cases the fact that you don't need an intermediary is very valuable and in the example of supply chain we've had examples particularly in the electronic supply chain where people have decided that they want to use blockchain to orchestrate their supply chain but you have multiple different vendors multiple different suppliers who all take possession of a module that they then send on to the next person to finish it or a distributor or whatever else and they can't share a single point of contact for that if you're a large electronics provider are you gonna trust your competitor to manage that data not a hope you have to use something like blockchain other examples of this are in financial services where we're seeing this being used for transactions but across Sur for stock trading for bond trading for collateralized debt etc and also for things like loan agreements where you have the credit financing or trade financing if you have blockchain and you put an invoice them there saying I have two million dollars worth of goods that I want to finance and you know that that two million dollar invoice is correct then you can get financing at much lower rates but you can't do that unless you have something like the block change and put this on there then we have other examples market rate places etc people are using this for things as diverse as settling air miles between airlines we're seeing that with Singapore Airlines and others and Identity Management again another thing where we're seeing a lot of action particularly around governments where they're looking to modernize their infrastructure for managing people's records or business records etc so some fairly progressive governments like Estonia and elsewhere actually doing a lot to digitize using distributed ledger technologies in the blockchain and the final piece here is autonomous m2m interactions where we're seeing for a particularly IOT and m2m applications people are loot using blockchain at the edge so not only you can provision some of this equipment and we'll see that this may relate to telecom as well but also it provides a very resilient way of allowing transactions and micro payments between machines and without relying on a central database to manage all of the volumes so a big map here and I'm going to just share very quickly some of the momentum that we're seeing in some of these examples so just to point out that this is actually moving very quickly this is a little map here all just the last year of all of the action and supply chain and I know we're not here to talk about supply chain but this is a good example of what we've seen in an industry this may be a year or two ahead of telecom in terms of the adoption but it's moving very very quickly now so what we're seeing here I won't go into detail to all of these is that in specific verticals so for example Pharma for the food supply chain for the electronic supply chain some fairly large moves are being made by some big players so very interesting in pharma they have a big problem with anti counterfeiting there's also challenges around managing sort of drug trial information where right now it's being stored in islands of information and you need to protect it from hacking or all sorts of regulations around health data but blockchains an excellent solution for sharing that information to other examples that want to bring up and this is one that I think is really exciting is Walmart is actually because it's a very very very powerful retailer is actually forcing its sorry for things maybe not the right word asking its vendors to use a blockchain to do track and trace and all of the foods so that if you have from Pharma all the way through to Walmart itself if there's a recall for some food that has bacteria or whatever else it is in it you can quickly identify the source of that and stop it and then move on and do the recall so a lot of savings to be done there and then the other ones that we've heard about at Maersk an IBM doing revolutionising shipping using blockchain and finally even a World Wildlife Fund has created an ethical product the blockchain that allows us to track and trace where products came from a lot going on here so let's talk a little bit about where the supplies in telecoms so we've identified many use cases in telecom and again this is a relatively early stage of the developments here but there are three basic categories the first is under infrastructure management so things like supply chain full life cycle track and trace the second is around cost and efficiency and then the final one is enabling new business models which in hopefully will allow increased ARPU or various other things that are big benefits where we think that telecom providers are very well placed to to do something good here I'll jump into a couple of examples here and just go through some of some of the potential here to collect your appetites but some examples are under infrastructure management we're seeing supply chain we actually talked about but it's the same idea here where's my stuff and frankly what does it have in it one of the other use cases we're seeing with network equipment in and for cyber insurance which is a brand new category is using the blockchain as a way of actually can controlling and understanding and knowing what configurations have been put on the equipment what software patches what updates and if you do that and you have a verifiable record of what has been done where and what the configurations are you can get cyber insurance so lots of lots of things that are good for that another one is under IOT device provisioning and management so people are using the blockchain to actually sort of authenticate devices and provide a channel to actually send the data back when they have IOT sensors creating data so two other things that are the big categories into carrier settlement I'll have an example of that and roaming authorization and then the final one is around new business models most of which is really based around identity as a service so if you know the customers identity you can layer on these additional business models so privacy and preference management's which will come to payments for example it's a very logical use case to jump into and then things like loyalty management for programs there's one other here which is around digital rights management for media and so on but basically there's a lot of different use cases that can be enabled once you know the identity and have that in the blockchain you can add these things on relatively easily so a couple of quick examples here just a little bit more detail this example here is for automating roaming agreements so today on the Left we have the examples of how it typically works you have a roaming agreements with different carriers and what will happen is a roaming user will visit a different network there'll be a cold data record created it'll go through a data Clearinghouse and then once the data clearinghouse has passed the information on etcetera Doe be a payment released at a certain time in a certain place now to be clear it's sir from what I understand it works quite well there but there are a few disadvantages and the biggest one that I'm hearing is round roaming fraud so frequently a symbol be created that will basically be allowed to use services to which the user is not allowed and that will create fraud which the latest numbers I've seen have been around 11 bill dollars a year globally so it's a pretty large amount of money to be losing and in the blockchain scenario you're able to actually stop a lot of that so the difference is with the blockchain if you have multiple carriers all on the same block chain network they're able to see the same information about the authentication of which user is allowed to use which services and that's also really interesting is that you're also able to hit the blockchain to authenticate a user see what services they're allowed and they're using the blockchain you can actually execute a contract a smart contract that will authorize the billing payment once the call or data service is completed so a very nice set of rails at a very secure way of showing sharing the data across a different carriers and automating this and the best the best estimates are this will save a great majority of some of the roaming fraud that's out there so good use case this one's on the cost side let's talk a little bit about a use case around identity as a service and some of the things that we can layer on from that this is the typical scenario on the Left II game so you have two things going on here one is that users would love to be able to access services these could be government services these could be bank services etc but at the end of the day they're being held back because the basic level of security required may just not be sufficient for the healthcare providers or whoever else to actually release the information on the other side you have advertisers that are trying to reach users and would love to be able to actually sell products and services and ideally a legal and authorized way the reality is it's a very inefficient and fragmented market particularly for advertisers if you're Google or Facebook great you've got great data you know how to hit those users if you're everybody else it's much much harder and the reality is that understanding who the users are targeting them by demographic by you know what kind of propensity they have for buying certain services is very difficult but if you were able to create an identity as a service and actually allow the consumers to control what information they're they share and allow the advertisers to access that in a secure way where they don't know who the end user is but they know enough about them to target them well then it's a win-win and so a scenario that we see on the right hand side would be a fully blockchain enabled network where the users would control what access they give to advertisers each advertiser a large advertiser would have a blockchain node and we able to see well if I want to reach a certain pool of users with a certain demographic or a certain kind of profile of what they want to buy I can do that I don't know they are but I can do it and so you're able to actually create an advertiser in theory and advertising network plus a lot of other and services by using by leveraging this identity so again a very powerful capability with a lot of advantages over the existing ways to do things now I'm going to talk a little bit about how this has basically worked in the past and some of the advantages and disadvantages that we've seen in blockchain so far so it sounds all great so far but the reality is and I'm going to use the cricket term here we're in the early innings of blockchain and particularly enterprise blockchain so some of the challenges that have been historically faced and are being addressed steadily as we speak around the technological maturity blockchain is us as a technologies only ten years old and enterprise blockchain has grown enormously in the last five years but is still some ways to go around performance and scalability it's being worked on very very hard right now the second issue is around business case clarity this isn't easy to understand and the map that I showed you a few slides ago is relatively new we're getting a good idea of where this is but many industries are really struggling to understand what can we do this difference that we couldn't do with blockchain and it just is going to take some time the third issue is around seeding the market so if you're trying to create a new service or a product and you want to create a network effect business it turns out it's actually quite hard to do that in most industries because you need to corral a lot of people you need to get a critical mass you need to spend a lot of time advertising these new products and services to people who haven't had it before and that's not typically easy now we we love the idea of these network effect businesses but the reality is they're not easy to execute fourth issue is around ecosystem incentives the incentives for participating particularly in a complex scenario like supply chain actually vary enormously and we've looked at supply chains in the past in aerospace and automotive and what we found is two things and no surprise one is the intermediaries actually don't like the block chain very much shouldn't be too surprising and the second is that actually the incentives to set up participate are very very different and you need to design that as part of your business model before you go out the gate otherwise you will find that you'll hit a roadblock somebody just won't want to participate and then you're not going to get the benefits you expect so you've got to manage these very carefully it doesn't mean they can't be solved it's just the things to think about and then the final one is regulatory uncertainty it's not necessarily the case that there there is that there's always problems with regulations but typically regulations lag technology and in cases like gdpr and Europe where there's the right to be forgotten which is something that block chains typically try not to forget they typically have a memory that lasts forever so there's there's ways to get around that but typically you need to think about how to how to design your block chain and your system to manage around some of these regulations sometimes now the good news is it's different in telecom so I'm just going to conclude with something for you to think about here that's actually quite exciting and why this is a better technology for telecom in many ways one is a technological maturity you're facing the same challenges as everyone else but it's moving very quickly and clearly that the performance is there now under business case clarity one of the best things here is that it's actually fairly obvious where some of the money is the stuff that I mentioned about four or five slides ago about the cost efficiencies can be calculated fairly simply around the business models it's relatively clear where the opportunity is and the challenge here really is how to get it like how quickly can you move how quickly can one network operator or another actually capture that market and make these efficiencies happen the second is around ceding the market city the market telecom companies have an enormous advantage here they've got millions of captive users to which they can market these new products and services and also in many cases industry concentration means that if you want to get a critical mass across multiple telecom carriers you don't have too many conversations to have before you can achieve that in other industries that is not the case there are way more fragments it is much harder to do that the third thing here in this list is around ecosystem incentives I gave an example of supply chain I could also give you examples though in financial services where different participants really want very markedly different things and incenting them to participate is difficult in telecom you have very similar business models having a conversation in a concentrated market with other colleagues to basically create a new service that spans different providers can be much easier you have the same incentives you know what your business models are having those conversations will be much faster and in the final piece around regulatory uncertainty this works both ways sometimes the regulations will trail the technology but kudos to you in this case it's actually led the technology and so it works both ways but you have an awesome opportunity here created and I am very excited about the future of blockchain in telecom we've seen a few examples so far are people applying it but I think we're literally the cusp of seeing this expand enormously for the reasons that I've given so I hope you have a great rest of the day I hope this gave you an idea of the potential here and some of the other things that you can do with this and that this has a really exciting future thank you [Applause]"}, {"id": "11Z4-XYoZAE", "link":

with the use of counterfeit medicines individuals families and health systems are staggering every year more than 122 thousand African children under the age of five lose their lives as a result of counterfeit antimalarials alone what if we could track trace and authenticate the drugs at each stage of their journey from the pharma company all the way to the patient that's exactly what researchers at the IBM lab in Haifa Israel are doing we're using blockchain technology to introduce traceability and track ability into the supply chain using blockchain we can make sure there's a verifiable provenance of what is delivered by whom to whom when and where within the pharma supply chain we're setting up a trusted network that allows the different parties to store information knowing that only authorized members can see it and the information can't be altered once it's been entered specifically for pharmaceutical orders we can verify that the authentic drugs are handed over to an authorized party at each transfer point ensure compliance with the proper conditions for transportation and asset transfer and we can also make sure that a joint verified ledger of all transactions is available at all times this means provenance of each and every drug in the supply chain any party in the network can see the status of where the drugs are and who has them this solution from IBM research includes the mobile interface and the permission blockchain back-end that gives each certified and authorized party in the network a way to initiate action finish their transaction track its progress and verify that it was done correctly let's look at an example of how this would work this is dr. Massiah she needs to Berkey Llosa's vaccines for her patients dr. Massiah already checked the prices at the local pharmacies and decided to order from ABC Pharma she knows that if she arranges delivery from the pharmacy using blockchain she'll have more confidence that the drugs are authentic and also get a better price at ABC Pharma in Kenya Imani received an order from dr. Massiah and kuru asking for three BCG ampoules the order is registered in the blockchain Imani prepares the delivery for dr. Massiah and kuru and scans the QR codes and serial numbers of the vaccines for the blockchain the order is ready to go and the next step involves selecting the delivery carrier from the list of possible carriers available in the blockchain system Imani selects Solomon who has a good reputation score and is not overloaded with orders today Solomon is motivated to supply a high quality service because his reputation score is calculated based on the ratings he received this reputation score helps him get more business from other hospitals and clinics he heads to ABC Pharma where he needs Imani when he arrives Solomon authenticates to the blockchain system Imani initializes the delivery transfer and then Solomon checks the serial numbers of the vaccines and accepts the delivery all this is recorded and the transaction is appended to the blockchain ledger after verifying that both Imani and Solomon are physically at the ABC Pharma premises Solomon heads out the BCG vaccines are stored in a refrigerated box equipped with temperature sensors the sensors Center reading every 60 seconds and any alarms are saved in the blockchain Solomon arrives in kuru and heads to dr. messias clinic dr. Massey agreed Solomon and they both examine the delivery dr. Massiah received an SMS earlier with the tracking code together they authenticate using the blockchain dr. Massiah verifies the tracking code number of the delivery and scans in and verifies the vaccines using a QR code scanner she also verifies via blockchain that there were no alerts regarding the temperature during transport dr. Massey accepts the delivery Solomon accepts the delivery transfer and the transfer is appended to the blockchain which now shows the vaccines at the quarry location Solomon's reputation score and number of open deliveries are updated and dr. messias can continue keeping her patients healthy back at ABC Pharma Yamane examines the status of today's blockchain transactions happily all went well with the transfer to dr. Massiah this innovative blockchain solution from IBM research offers new benefits it reduces the loss from counterfeit drugs offers shorter lead times of cycles from Pharma to patients and introduces a non-repudiation process with provenance and track ability for fast resolution as any conflicts contact us at IBM research to get your customized solution [Music]"}, {"id": "SSo_EIwHSd4", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4", "title": "How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained", "channel": "Simply Explained", "duration": "6:00", "views": 4550417, "published": "3 years ago", "transcript": " Blockchains are incredibly popular nowadays. But what is a blockchain? How do they work, what problems do they solve\nand how can they be used? Like the name indicates, a blockchain is a\nchain of blocks that contains information. This technique was originally described in\n1991 by a group of researchers and was originally intended to timestamp digital documents so\nthat it\u2019s not possible to backdate them or to tamper with them. Almost like a notary. However it went by mostly unused until it\nwas adapted by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 to create the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that\nis completely open to anyone. They have an interesting property: once some\ndata has been recorded inside a blockchain, it becomes very difficult to change it. So how does that work? Well, let\u2019s take a closer look at a block. Each block contains some data, the hash of\nthe block and the hash of the previous block. The data that is stored inside a block depends\non the type of blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain for example stores\nthe details about a transaction in here, such as the sender, receiver and amount of coins. A block also has a hash. You can compare a hash to a fingerprint. It identifies a block and all of its contents\nand it's always unique, just as a fingerprint. Once a block is created, it\u2019s hash is being\ncalculated. Changing something inside the block will cause\nthe hash to change. So in other words: hashes are very useful\nwhen you want to detect changes to blocks. If the fingerprint of a block changes, it\nno longer is the same block. The third element inside each block is the\nhash of the previous block. This effectively creates a chain of blocks\nand it\u2019s this technique that makes a blockchain so secure. Let's take an example. Here we have a chain of 3 blocks. As you can see, each block has a hash and\nthe hash of the previous block. So block number 3 points to block number 2\nand number 2 points to number 1. Now the first block is a bit special, it cannot\npoint to previous blocks because it's the first one. We call this the genesis block. Now let's say that you tamper with the second\nblock. This causes the hash of the block to change\nas well. In turn that will make block 3 and all following\nblocks invalid because they no longer store a valid hash of the previous block. So changing a single block will make all following\nblocks invalid. But using hashes is not enough to prevent\ntampering. Computers these days are very fast and can\ncalculate hundreds of thousands of hashes per second. You could effectively tamper with a block\nand recalculate all the hashes of other blocks to make your blockchain valid again. So to mitigate this, blockchains have something\ncalled proof-of-work. It's a mechanism that slows down the creation\nof new blocks. In Bitcoins case: it takes about 10 minutes\nto calculate the required proof-of-work and add a new block to the chain. This mechanism makes it very hard to tamper\nwith the blocks, because if you tamper with 1 block, you'll need to recalculate the proof-of-work\nfor all the following blocks. So the security of a blockchain comes from\nits creative use of hashing and the proof-of-work mechanism. But there is one more way that blockchains\nsecure themselves and that's by being distributed. Instead of using a central entity to manage\nthe chain, blockchains use a peer-to-peer network and anyone is allowed to join. When someone joins this network, he gets the\nfull copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to verify that everything\nis still in order. Now let's see what happens when someone creates\na new block. That new block is send to everyone on the\nnetwork. Each node then verifies the block to make\nsure that it hasn't been tampered with. If everything checks out, each node adds this\nblock to their own blockchain. All the nodes in this network create consensus. They agree about what blocks are valid and\nwhich aren't. Blocks that are tampered with will be rejected\nby other nodes in the network. So to successfully tamper with a blockchain\nyou'll need to tamper with all blocks on the chain, redo the proof-of-work for each block\nand take control of more than 50% of the peer-to-peer network. Only then will your tampered block become\naccepted by everyone else. This is almost impossible to do! Blockchains are also constantly evolving. One of the more recent developments is the\ncreation of smart contracts. These contracts are simple programs that are\nstored on the blockchain and can be used to automatically exchange coins based on certain\nconditions. More on smart contracts in a later video. The creation of blockchain technology peaked\na lot of people\u2019s interest. Soon, others realized that the technology\ncould be used for other things like storing medical records, creating a digital notary\nor even collecting taxes. So now you know what a blockchain is, how\nit works on basic level and what problems it solves. Want to learn how you can implement a simple\nblockchain with Javascript?

Industry", "channel": "CXOTV news", "duration": "5:34", "views": 328, "published": "1 year ago", "transcript": " [Music] so I see this you know this is going to have a huge impact there would be a paradigm shift you know bringing IIT and you know I already get locked in into automotive industry if I talk about use cases there would be you know five important use case which I feel this will have a paradigm shift now the use case can be it can be you know how do you really drive the car whether you do this as a driver assist mode or you do this as a IV autonomous vehicle there are two different things so IOT and AI can play a large role in terms of assisting you that what they said that you are doing in terms of driving and what are the corrective actions which you have to take at the same time it can uses all of the GPS sensors cameras infrared it's different information which comes from climate weather and all to do autonomous you know driving that's one of the very important use case second use case if you talk about would be how do we leverage on AI information in cloud if suppose we gather all of the information at one consolidated place in cloud what we can do is this we can do all things related to predictive modeling how do we do a prediction of the vehicle that what's going to happen in the vehicle or what is it which I can do in terms of the maintenance this if I use this cloud information I can even know that what is that which is there for me as a you know as a user of the past so there are arts which can we please there are you know pop-ups which can come telling me about my behavior or not third is this insurance is a big big use case for here if I use this and all of the insurance can happen or a claim of the insurance can happen on a real-time basis so if you see there is a lot of use case potential for the insurance see generally what happens is this we pay insurance premium basis a fixed amount can we do that this is my driving behavior if suppose I have a a ie a can take a stack of it that how am i driving what is my driving behavior is rate am going to doing accidents or not and this is that the insurance premium can be done if I talk about the fourth important thing fourth important thing is my manufacturing industry 4.0 we talk about any automotive industry there's a lot of potential so robotics is anyway happening there's a lot of potential when you're using IOT s we can really do a fast and smart manufacturing so automobiles can be you know can embark on to a journey which is very customized last but not the least it's all about the driving behavior you know II is can install sensors in the car which can lead the humans face it can reach the posture of the body it's then can read the behavior of the eyes and all and tell you that whether you are in a good position to drive or not so I see there's a lot of potential in AI yo t and next five years there's going to be a paradigm shift with all of these five use cases coming reality into play see anyway if you see Google is doing heavy investment into the I based you know vehicles so there is a project called as why more pitchers there so Google is already building autonomous vehicle which is totally totally enabled with IIT and here you know a feature if you talk about Tesla Tesla is already doing it so this is already in play next five years yes more and more things will come out why because this is spending due to some regulatory approvals otherwise technology wise you know it has quality I at least me I and IOT has already matured and it's going to be used in next five years definitely perfect okay the cost if I talk about the costs it costs are drastically coming down if I give you some data of the cost last you know couple of years if you see the cost of the sensors have come down 50x like the cost has almost you know come down drastically if you if you talk about the cost of the networks costs of the networks have come down if you talk about the computation power competition power has increased so generally I see there's a trend of declining cost and there's a lot of innovation which is happening next five years definitely the cost will come down so that it becomes more affordable in having said that we see this only from the dollar perspective we have to see AI and IOT from the qualitative perspective also so India has embarked on to the journey so it needs to start with there are companies like you know Nissan the companies like food and Maruti they have already started adopting two telematics journey so definitely next five year there won't be a paradigm shift and Indian Auto means they also will be embarking with industry [Music] [Applause] for more updates from cxo TV please like and subscribe to our

we transact with each other so it's not technology driven even though it may appear like this is technology driven technology is an inherent part of it and that's a much bigger thing because think about if we as humans how do we trust each other how do we make sure whatever we agree on we can execute you and both consumers and businesses can comply to it blockchain will be a revolution we are in still early stages we still have very few in established applications as platforms essentially the technology will have to scale to provide you know the scalability the security you can't afford to have hacks if you're building you know blockchain for enterprise solutions consumers will have to look at adoption it's that the model is very important on what model we also you see about human behavior what human behavior model and how technology is all set so both on solutions and on platform side it's a fundamental change blockchain is not the unisom technology will solve everything you still need artificial intelligence you still need identity based technologies how will they integrate together so the engineers will have to integrate the two words the word of this new emerging models and the word of the emerging technologies and how they tie together a blockchain you know if you are if you can trust the information you're providing now is this can we enhance this information can it have intelligence embedded in it so there's a lot of applications of how not only you want to share trustworthy information you also want to be intelligent about detecting what type of information it is or have predictions with it or have projections with it if you are having somebody provide the information on the blockchain how do you make sure this is the right person before you even trust the information so what is the identity for that person is their identity technology foolproof will it actually scale with how blockchain will scale so we believe they will be an integration across all of these technologies again it is model-driven to my point earlier it's the new fundamental models with which businesses and consumers will operate will be facilitating how these integrations take place"}, {"id": "tuiO3iDkH3Y", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuiO3iDkH3Y", "title": "Blockchain game \"harbor bcg\", promotional video", "channel": "Aquariumy Studio

this brief introduction i will welcome dr paritos basu uh to start his presentations and guide us regarding the blockchain mr basu thank you ca it is indeed my proud privilege and pleasure to be amongst such a galaxy of chartered accountants and i feel whenever i come to this kind of a meeting i feel i have come to my home back in 1975 i started my ca studies and i have from 1975 till today i am associated with the learning of accounting and finance and and from 1994 i started gathering interest in the area of i.t that means information technology and thereafter i got into digital transformation as a subject and presently i keep writing uh i i keep writing on many areas of digital transformation uh you might have got i do not know whether ca madam mehta has shared with you my papers which i have already shared as a reading i will share at the end of the session actually okay fine so this is my this is my presentation madam this is industry 4.0 and uh let me start with the permission of all of you i have used quite a lot of graphics and quite a lot of information from cyberspace which are freely available i acknowledge the contribution of those research scholars who have helped us to build this knowledge paper and i am not using any one of these for my personal business purposes let me uh start with the simple point that in 1780 when mechanization first came when human labor and animal labor was replaced by power of water and steam that we called first industrial revolution and then came and then came the second industrial revolution about 100 about 90 years after when in 1870 the electrical power was invented and it replaced the power of steam and water it took about another 100 years to come to 1970 when we got the benefit of computers and industrial automation started that was industry 3.0 that was industry 3.0 and then then came industry 4.0 which is today and as of now it started somewhere around late 1990s when the first use of digital technology started in between we had another mid codes industrial revolution we called globalization but come what may what is important and what is emerging is this message that what has brought us here will not take us there it does mean that we have to also transform ourselves with business knowledge let me take you to this small graph if our business insight is high but our techno if our business inside is high but our technological insight our financial efficiency is low then we are considered as a scorekeeper or a or a centralized constrained advisor essentially we have to have very high financial efficiency and also a very high business insight if these two happens together we will be considered as a value aggregator and the work finance efficiency now today also includes our digital efficiency because most of the work which will be performing in this real life will be definitely through digital trans digital platform so i am grateful to the jb nogger cp study circle and they have considered that point of mind which i say here our realizations of tomorrow are limited by our questions of today and that because all the jb never study circle chartered accountants have a question about blockchain technology that is why we are all meeting here to know what is blockchain technology let me tell you how the world is going to emerge very soon in this world by it's it's an ascension analysis it's a research it says that by 2030 we'll be having 8.5 billion population 1 billion will be added two thirds of the world population will living in urban areas we have to have extreme transparency in whatever we do we cannot live with a hush-hush world the climate crisis will not leave even richest of the rich countries you know 30 million hectares are burning in west of america and millions of animals wild animals have been burnt in australia so climate crisis is going to be very important problem resource pressure will be such that even the bounty of nature that is breathable air and drinkable water will not be available very soon clean technology is no longer that you cannot emit carbon but the train technology will be soon such that you have to bring down carbon from the atmosphere otherwise world will not supply survive uh technology shift will take place in such a manner by 2030 each one of us will be definitely under the direct influence of about five internet of things uh one your handphone which you use is one of those internet of things and the and the broadband facility which you use is one of those internet of things and will be under the influence of 25 internet of things my october paper uh uh which i have written on digital transformation it talks about this internet of things this is shipped for manufacturing business for smart factory uh the global policies are going to be such that uh it will talk about anything and everything which you do will be questioned so there has to be a global policy like international aviation law which is followed by 195 countries without a comma and a full stop being changed and right or wrong radicalism and nationalism will increase as we know those countries which taught us globalization they are themselves getting into protectionism and pandemics will continue to increase so you have you have seen that up to point number seven i have given a star marks and these star marks indicate that blockchain technology either can deal with these problems or can mitigate the issues or risks that will emanate from these problems going forward in the world there are um number of use cases have been established in blockchain but there is a wrong perception amongst the common people that blockchain is cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency is blockchain i'm sure by the evening six o'clock when we finish this webinar you will be convinced that blockchain is not equal to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency is not equal to blockchain cryptocurrency just one of the use cases or one of the first uses of blockchain technology right or wrong whether you want or not digital transformation has it has been started in this world [Music] and these tools will touch the core of our business functions across all hierarchies this will touch us across all hierarchies and and we will have to deal with it we'll have to live with it digital transformation has not only touched our life it also touched our business because every organizations are in in some way or the other in limited or unlimited capacity or unlimited level is definitely touching digital technology and adopting digital technology but a recent study by linkedin has been has shown that in countries like singapore china japan taiwan south korea hong kong vietnam blockchain has emerged as one of the most fastest going still demanding area so that is the subject matter of our discussion because according to me blockchain is at the moment a little slow started but it will soon prove proof to be a powerhouse of industrial technology 4.0 and it thereafter it will transform itself to a foundational technology which will be able to transform the societal foundation and economic foundation of any country including richest of the rich and poorest of their poor countries here's a very interesting uh guidance from oecd so i will request my professional colleagues to spend some uh thought on this this particular guidance which have been given by oecd talks about three pillars of digital transformation one is good governance second is the efficiency and third is effectiveness now if you meet good governance with efficiency you get reliability participation citizens drive and public value if you meet efficiency with effectiveness you get empowerment you get evidence demand management and personalization and if you meet effectiveness with god good governance you get openness transparency accountability and autonomy now these 12 elements are 12 attributes or 12 qualities which oecd has oecd has suggested oecd is organization of economic cooperation and development which has suggested for its member countries to follow if i if i uh can tell you and if i have your permission to tell you before i present this paper you will find that blockchain can comply with all the oecd guidelines and can achieve all the 12 attributes of good management for the ultimate benefit of humanity to bring in inclusive smile across people across the societal strata of the world so blockchain technology is going to be not only the powerhouse of industry 4.0 but is going to be the foundational technology of the world very soon you can say we have not heard about many much applications but as you go as i go ahead with my presentation you will find that things are changing now uh there are seven layers of digital transformation erp is essentially not digital transformation honestly speaking erp or enterprise resource planning or sap or oracle financials etc etc which we have used up till say sap 6.0 those are accounting and operation control systems of course it had a lot of capabilities uh which digital transformation system requires or it has some of the capabilities of digital transformation tools but essentially these are data creation and data handling capabilities but as you know this particular slide which is being shown to you it talks about seven layers of data management data aggregation data management data workflow data process component data platform interface integration end-to-end processing and front-end software these are the seven layers of data management and let me tell you blockchain technology can definitely handle all these seven layers of digital transformation and and not only that if you have if you read my paper on kishan blockchain platform or blockchain for healthcare you will find that six major digital technologies can be infused and integrated with blockchain transformation system so that from one platform with integration of many other digital tools you can deliver all the benefits of digital transformation uh this is a very interesting slide uh as a chartered accountant you will be you will be knowing also that any technology may be operation technology that means manufacturing technology and and digital technology whatever it can be it can be divided into two groups one is the business impact group one is the transformational group now business impact groups are those which helps to improve your operations and improve value addition somewhere in 2016 blockchain came somewhere end of 1990s blocked in somewhere in 2016 uh when blockchain uh started getting a lot of case studies uh base use case uh proofs and it of course the use case proof started somewhere in 2008 2012 it got quite a bit of momentum it was being considered that blockchain is a high impact creating creating a technology it does mean that if you use blockchain you will be considerably you improving your speed and quality of work and able to save a lot of money that was perhaps the idea about blockchain technology it was not being considered still as a transformational technology like 3d printing drones automated vehicles smart machines advanced robotics brain machine interface this was not considered originally this these were not considered that way so so uh these are not being considered blockchain was not being considered a strong belief uh if i'm uh my research is such that my strong belief that blockchain will not only move from high impact creating technology but also it will cut its own niche which will be considered as a foundational technology blockchain will be become a foundational technology that means it will not only transform but it will change the foundation of economics and society of a country that is my idea this slide brings to you all the eight major technologies which are there today in digital air there being blockchain drones internet of things robots 3d printing virtual reality augmented reality and artificial intelligence now you will find uh of course internet of things has now come internet of bodies also in if you read my health care paper you will find i have extensively written about internet of body and artificial intelligence also i have written in some of my earlier papers now look at this starts the blue stars indicate that technologies that can be simultaneously applied it does mean that blockchain as a technology can be to simultaneously drone internet of things artificial intelligence 3d printing and robots and and robots in fact in fact in my paper on kishan because blockchain i have done an integration of this all technologies where i have called it clichondrikas blockchain platform but i have also shown the the applications of these technologies which are tick marked here and con and shown that controlled controlling of all these digital applications can be done through blockchain technology uh friends you must have heard about each computing you know if you introduce edge computing that means computing at the stage where you are collecting the information which is called h computing broadly then you will be able to reduce the load on your cloud computing requirement now given that kind of a situation the blockchain again can have the benefit of introducing cloud com edge computing at the technology ends for this right tick technologies and it can control these applications at its own end so blockchain is a very interesting technology so far as i am concerned and i'm sure you'll be convinced as i go forward very interesting statement uh uh here the statement here it is it is being said that and i am borrowing from bhagavad-gita which is my guiding book from from indian mythology bhagavad-gita says and i quote we are born into the world of nature our second birth is into the world of spirit but he who with strong body serving mind gives us his power toward the work it does mean that that digital transformation as it as a as a subject or digital transformation as a task and responsibility cannot be done and completed by might of your body what you need is power of mind what you need is power of mind and what you need is lot of imagination and determination that's why albert einstein also said that the true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination so friends uh today if you feel that as a chartered accountant as much knowledge i gathered that much powerful i become but the situation is changing you become a value aggregator you can become a value aggregator if your power of imagination improves and your power of imagination imagination can improve only and only when you start thinking so technology application needs lot of thinking this is another very interesting uh finding from deloitte university deloitte university says that and it's a little aged data that only only 10 percent of whatever data we generate only 10 of the data we used to generate in 2013 now 10 times of that will be generated now that means whatever data we generate now 44 zettabytes one zeta byte is equal to one uh uh one uh billion terabyte that is one zettabyte is equal to one billion terabyte so uh the digital world is growing and it will continue to grow but the biggest challenge is even by 2020 means around the time when we are leaving their prediction was only 37 percent of the data would have been would be analyzable analyzable data means a data which can be brought into a digital system and can be analyzed rest of the data cannot be analyzed so the challenge in front of blockchain technologies is how to make stored data analyzable and that is possible that is possible because blockchain technology is thinking of controlling internet of things the moment you control internet of things your mobile devices will be coming under the analyzable category uh because 27 percent of the data you will generate in future will come from uh will was on is only predictable to be analyzable so the most important thing one has to understand that it is generation of data is not only important analysis of data is also important so any digital transformation system that you create it has to have capacity to analyze you cannot keep not keep noting down your questions i can answer towards the end now this this particular slide is very important for our chartered accountants i am sure up to this they must be auditing in today's environment let us think of banks in 1970s or 1980s or 1990s assume that each node is as each node is a these are branches this these circles are branches now these circles used to deposit on the data do their computing in their own branch computers and they had only connectivity with the bank's central server and those servers uh used they used to deposit the days and trial balance or month and trial balance whatever they were not doing online processing of transaction which was visible to their central bank they were doing some limited applications which are needed for their central office to process then came the system can be changed to decentralized system now these are the perhaps the state-based servers where every single branch of the state is connected to a central server of the state and that state server is now connected to the central server of the bank so it is a decentralized system steel that all the nodes are not connected with all the nodes one of the most important requirement of blockchain technology under mesh group is that all the nodes all the computers which are working in a blockchain platform has to be connected with all the nodes so this is called distributed technology so we transform the computing system of erp from centralized erp to decentralized erp up to that up to this stage it is erp after this it becomes distributed blockchain banks are still not working on block distributed platform except which i was talking to some of the private sector top banks for because we are doing a research on digital transformation of indian banks uh we came to know a few of their platforms are working on blockchain technology which is called trade finance so trade finance they are working on blockchain technology which is a distributed how this looks like this looks like this sorry this looks like this here assume that there are only five people working and you can see from the sign of these arrows i'm talking about this picture you can see from the sign of the arrows that each computer is connected with each computer that is the beauty of blockchain technology i'm on the technical part of blockchain now each computer is connected with each computer that means suppose a transaction has been done by a and b this transaction not only will be recorded in is and b's computer but it will also populate the computers of c d and e that means any transaction done by anybody in a blockchain platform will be known to anybody and everybody how it is known in a blockchain in today's banking system or any system we our identity is our phone number or is our account code number or is our mail id we are more known by our phone number and maybe than our name in fact my father gave me a name chandra basu because chandra is our family name but kharsi digital technologies my middle name went out because digital technology does not recognize the middle name so still today i am recognized by purity chandra basu but i'm more recognized by my mail id and my phone number because logging into anything i need my phone number or all this thing the mail id but in blockchain technology none of these are required in a blockchain technology you will be doing a kyc of yourself or kyp quality induction technology is called kyp know your participant but this participant who is a participant in a blockchain technology suppose this is a healthcare technology an insurer need not at all know or even have a picture on name or mail id or phone number of a person whom he is insuring because in a blockchain technology you will be using two keys one is your private key and one is your public key when you are logging into any of these computers you will log in with your private key which is generated by you when the transaction gets posted into the blockchain distributed ledger it will be converted to a public key conversion and nobody will be able to know who are you in healthcare system only hospital physician and surgeon and pathologist will be coming in physical contact with a uh with a patient they don't even need need to know what is his name they didn't even need to know what is his phone number and reality because in their system that person will appear with a public key which is nothing but a 20 25 digit coded number okay so blockchain technology operates with a dual key system and it operates with the distributed ledger system as you can see this is the distributed ledger any transaction happening in any of the computers it will be updating in other computers also so there is no centralized supervision required in blockchain if you see here in this kind of technologies you have a centralized supervision here on your ledger but in blockchain technology there is no centralized supervision here no centralized supervision because at the center there is no node now how the insect happens here the transaction happens suppose this is the starting point so this gentleman will be having a public key he will generate certain transaction which will go to the concerned party as a data this date concerned person will enter into system with his key and get in and do his transaction will which will get to the next content concern party as a data and he will know who has sent this data to him as a pointer which is his key and this way the process will go on this process is called uh popularly miracle root uh let me not get into that uh technology part because this is quite critical i also don't even know this area much because i am not a coder at all so conceptually uh at this stage let me tell you this friends that i have invented a particular software for conversion of any accounts i am talking about annual accounts and reporting accounts from any gap of the world to any gap of the world like i have indian capital for his ifrs to indian gap u.s gap to i for his iphone's previous gap and if you start if you search dr means doctor and say patent after that you will be able to find one of my my own self-created engine along with two of my co-inventors is was pending for registration with usa and it was it was populated in the usa patent registration site so that's how i am connected with technology what happens in the within the black box i do not know but i know the conceptual understanding and how it happens within the blockchain but how the codes are written i will not be able to explain you because that is not my domain so this is how the blockchain technology works it works with the distributed technology that's why blockchain is also called dlt distributed ledger technology and the network for blockchain is called p2p network people-to-people network it's a dual key mechanism cryptographically enabled without any central supervision and it operates uh with a hash ball hashing of block system this is what essentially the technicalities of a blockchain technology let me let me tell you why blockchain technology is full in table but before that let me explain to you uh the famous bitcoin uh configuration how bitcoin works this is a pwc uh slide uh in bitcoin as you know when bitcoin was invented or started in a blockchain technology there used to be people called miners some people have been given right to approve transaction earlier it used to be 50 of the miners have to be uh have to give consent to a transaction what is meant by a consent suppose uh you hear a wants to sell wants to buy some bitcoin so gets in open source blockchain for bitcoin and for that matter ethereum or any other uh cryptocurrency he says that i want to buy so his public key will be visible in the system and this will be announced to the whole world of the participants miners also will come to know so as per the rule uh as per the bitcoin rule or the platform's rule a certain percentage of the miners who knows who can mine the transaction will say that okay 10 units of uh of bitcoin whether b is an authorized holder of those bitcoins once uh once uh b says yes i want to sell so a and b has consented as for the contract embedded in the bitcoin system these miners will give a consent yes they can go ahead the moment they gives the consent it becomes a transaction and gets added to the block of transactions this is the way it functions i've explained to you in a very simplistic manner but that is exactly the way it functions a transaction is announced by and between two parties and as for the contractual agreement which is called a smart contract embedded in the blockchain technology i'll cover smart contract very soon with you and then it is consented by people and then it is uh by miners and here in the here in our healthcare it will be consented by the company for insurance contract and that then it will go into the system a blockchain technology cannot be cannot be changed by any malfudi intention player because uh in blockchain suppose this gentleman is trying to do some fraud with this particular transaction if he has to do the fraud with this transaction he has to not only change this block he has to change all these blocks because once this this is the current transaction which are processed by uh normal players in the system these people are doing the transaction and all the players in the system are having information about the transaction so if somebody wants to hack this transaction all the players who are participating in this blockchain all their systems have to be hacked otherwise it is not possible let me give you an example in uk a hospital's database was hacked so one fine morning the entire hospital operation can be conducted conducted no new medicine can be given to a party because all the computerized reports and prescriptions were shown as blank because somebody has hacked the database now unless and until you give the ransom upset 10 million pounds or 5 million pounds those hackers will not release the database that means if they only hack the central server of that uk hospital they can take the entire system into ransom but in a blockchain technology that is not possible because in blockchain technology all the data are available in all the databases of all the participants how many databases he will hack and of course you have to hack simultaneously all the databases the god has also not perhaps created that computer which can which can hack all the databases incidentally this slide has been taken from a paper published by the institute [Music] what is essentially a future ready solution what is essentially a future ready solution a future ready solution will look like this now i'm i'm trying to prove how blockchain technology is going to be a future ready technology a future ready technology is going to look like this uh it has to use people you remember of course you don't forget that oecd guidelines it has to gather ideas these are people a period of connected minds that is here in this kit could be customer it could be your patients could be farmers if it is a clinician blockchain platform this has to be uh power of minds that means what people want internet of data all the data which are getting generated are to be collected and analyzed and finally you cannot send suppose suppose in a paddy field the color of the paddy leaves color of the paddy leaves have become little yellowish a farmer who is farming hundreds of hectares let's assume that a farmer is 10 hectares paddy is not possible for him to run around the 10 hectares and find where the battery field has become yellowish so what he can do he can run a drone and drawn here will be treated as an internet of things the drone will take a video picture of his entire paddy field with a gps positioning of each location and provide data into the blockchain system or kishan blockchain and the farmer will get into look into this and see that the southwest corner about one acre area uh has got some attack of some insecticide that's where leaves and become yellow and those are to be given insecticide that is some treatment has to be done in case of business uh uh what you need you need that is uh i was talking about farmer blockchain so all these four things you need a business to establish trust win-win for all your stakeholders establish the value experience simplicity and ease of application and sustain with what you do and all these things can be done if you have a business if you have a customer if your product if you have a orchestrated collaborative dreamwork you promote your ideas and products you develop further by gaining experience from the market you control your business through system and finally you analyze your performance all this essentially gives you these strategies these fundamental requirements of conducting a business operations with the help of the business ecosystem of people idea data and things blockchain technology can support this entire requirement that is my thought now look at how the world has thought through about blockchain technology this is a capgemini research paper we produced in 2018 of course i'll share with you the 2020 research paper also very soon and 447 organizations were studied uh friends chartered accountants uh these are this is a very important slide for you to understand why blockchain technology why we should adopt blockchain technology guys who are adopting blockchain technologies or industrial organizations who are adopting blockchain technology what are they looking from this technology so uh this is the cycle of blockchain technology 2011 to 2018 it was a period of awareness and of course we are two hours two years delayed we are creating awareness in 2020 experimentation people started working with blockchain technology in a bigger way i'm talking about commercial purpose somewhere between 2017 20 20 20 i mean i'm leaving those organizations which are exceptional organization like ibm or bitcoin itself and 2019 to 25 is the period of transformation of business with blockchain technology now let's let's look at let's have this journey let's have this journey now these people who have been surveyed they say 89 says that if i adopt blockchain i'll be having cost saving 81 percent says that if i adopt blockchain i'll be able to trace your product it does mean that suppose sitting in sitting in a town of los angeles you are drinking or someone is drinking a sula wine which is produced in near nagpur sula vineyard now in the bottle there will be a there will be a tracing code and the tracing code if you trace with your smartphone you will be able to know that this particular uh wine was produced by a this particular wine was produced by sula and the grapes used for this wine was produced in a by a farmer who used to farm in this gps position of land in india so a government of canada is using blockchain technology for stopping marijuana or hash smuggling that means every single product can be traced with the help of blockchain technology 79 percent says that blockchain will give me transparency because everybody will come to know what transaction is being happening in blockchain technology 57 says my revenue will improve if i adopt blockchain technology 50 says my risk will reduce if i use blockchain technology 40 44 says that i'll be able to create new business because you will soon see the particular statistics from me that which has been studied by deloitte that some people are saying that either our best vendor or our customer or other ecosystems have transferred themselves to blockchain technology that's why i'll be also required to transfer myself to blockchain technology and 38 people say that if i have to have become customer centric then i have to become blockchain player uh how many types of blockchains are there okay let us finish that statistics part first then we will come to oh i'm sorry one minute give me a few minutes let me finish this particular slide first before we get into uh something else see uh in this slide this is a deloitte data deluxe conducted a study in 2020 2019 and 2018. 2018 their study was 2053 organization and 2020 they have studied 1488 organization now now 2020 data i will explain to you and you can see the graph movement 55 percent of the sales of the of the organization says that blockchain is critical for their strategic priorities and 27 percent says that important but not in their top five of the agenda that means 55 percent says it is critical and 27 percent says it is important so if you add 55 and 27 82 percent of the people says 82 percent of the people says that blockchain is either critical or it is important and 14 more additional 14 says that this is relevant and important only six percent have said that they have not concluded they have not either concluded or they have not done anything about it so point i'm trying to say point i'm trying to say that blockchain technology blockchain technology is assuming importance now there are certain doubts about blockchain technology which deloitte tried to ensure through this survey there is one doubt about blockchain technology whether blockchain is scalable because it is a peer-to-peer network so such a gigantic network can it be scaled up as the business scales up 88 percent fees that it can be scaled up 86 percent fees that there is a business case for it and 85 percent says they have a plan to replace their operational uh systems let me tell you uh friends here it's very important here perhaps it is coming into your mind that is blockchain and accounting platform or is blockchain an operational platform or is blockchain a transactional platform let me tell you blockchain is a predominantly transactional platform here you can do suppose your planet needs maintenance and through an internet of thing which is embedded to a machine it says that your such and such machine needs maintenance let me give you a very interesting story the aircraft in which you fly from say mumbai to gujarat on that clarakra engine has got couple of iots internet of thing this iot has got a lot of sensors and lot of information emitting systems so through uh satellite satellite communication now the health of the engine is being sensed by this particular iot and this iot is telling the engineers of the next landing aircraft that this particular part of this particular aircraft is not operating well before giving clearance from the for the next flight of this aircraft please check so uh the engineers will check and this particular information will also go to the manufacturer of the aircraft so it's a boeing or airbus they will also monitor the quality of the aircraft they have manufactured and delivered to a particular customer so so if it is not a it is not a commercial transaction it doesn't involve any payment or or any liability or any cash it's a maintenance transaction so blockchain is a transactional system for anything and everything for any function is blockchain then good for accounting answer is yes wherever you are assuming any liability or wherever you are doing a cash transaction or cryptographic currency transaction cryptocurrency transaction wherever you are being delivered a goods or whether you are being delivered a service blockchain technology will create a feed which will automatically populate a particular which can automatically populate a particular table of your sap or oracle financial or any other erp system once you allow that you can automate that field at that table also that it will automatically not only populate the table but also your accounting system or like you can say that you let the table be populated let me review it and pass it on so transactions are getting every time populated by what is happening in the blockchain transaction 83 says that my my organization or project will lose competitive advantage if i do not adopt blockchain so what i'm trying to say here that blockchain technology in the uh mainly in the western world among 1448 people this is the this is the mindset and this is the reality position of blockchain technology so blockchain technology is the three types blockchain and private blockchain public blockchain you need don't need any permission you have to do a simple kyc uh and private blockchain is of course unique permission private blockchains are operated by private parties like ibm has a supply chain blockchain or an exim blockchain uh and uh say icsa bank i believe have started a track finance blockchain you can have your own within enterprise blockchain i believe konkan railway has introduced a blockchain uh for document document management uh you have seen all good models and various businesses are done in malls some are selling you wearing apparel someone's selling shoes some are selling house world goods some are selling uh say linens anything and everything are being sold so it's a bazaar so blockchain can be is now being developed as a bazaar which is called blockchain as a service uh platform these are these service providers creates a blockchain environment in which suppose you are a guy who is uh who is uh trying to uh trying to uh sell music uh with with protection of the music creators and the lyric writers and singers you go to that wizard uh put your blockchain platform you have to just customize that blockchain platform put your smart contract and start operations so blockchain as a service has come up in a big way so you need not as an organization blockchain platform blockchain platforms are line ready only you come with your business rules your contracts and your customized requirement you can start operating a blockchain so this is called blockchain as a service uh this is a very interesting slide it has been developed by anton and grasso uh those of you who are in twitter and linkedin they can follow me uh i uh i have more than 15 000 followers in linkedin and about 1 350 plus followers in twitter i generally don't tweet anything on i don't tweet anything on politics and religion i only tweet on on human behavior in terms of human thinking life and digital technology and finance now this gentleman and graceo is one of the most renowned digital technologists of the world and digital evangelist of the world he has done a research paper uh from the perspective of bcg best in consulting groups he was originally in ppwc a blockchain technology has proliferated essentially in eight different areas one is consumer energy that is power financial institution health care industrial goods insurance public sector and technology media and telecommunication and blockchain technology can be classified in terms of growth into three areas one is linear growth one is network effects and one is mixed use case i'll give you an explanation of the network effects in australia old age home are run under blockchain i have seen that use case i met that party in moscow when where i chaired the world blockchain summit in moscow where i met this party this party runs a uh old age home suppose you are at the age of 50 and you feel that uh for whatever reasons good or bad you have to go to an old age home when you are old after finishing your working life so ten years before uh you can you book your room through blockchain technology so uh through for your old age so this is the network effect it is not a commercial of course you have to pay money uh or whatever donation whatever system for essentially a block network it's not a commercial blockchain uh some blockchain grows uh linear growth and some blockchain has got mixed growth of use cases so uh it's not possible to explain neither you can see it properly so i'm not getting into the details of it i'll show you some use cases very soon here is the use cases i will request my my friends to please spend two minutes to read this there are 36 line items in this slide in this table and uh these are collective cases where blockchain has been applied or tested for application or working interestingly and these are the areas where you as a finance man will be very much interested and these are the government areas and others just spend two minutes look at the blocks this is what i am very much interested for last few years i am talking about it and rizzo bank of india recently has announced the central bank digital rupee policy document for public discussion and imf has already come up with uh central bank digital currency uh policy document for discussion uh you can see a block in russia blockchain is being used for public voting it has been used as already records in india a proposal has already been submitted to supreme court of india for uh blockchain based record maintenance in america ghan safety and america gone and revolver is a mess gun safety is being controlled proposed to be controlled by blockchain disaster management can be can be controlled to buy a blockchain uh ipr that is intellectual property rights can be controlled through blockchain music filming system can be controlled to blockchain so blockchain technology almost can touch every single work of your life i'll move from this slide this is a this is a very interesting blockchain being operated by kenya where the front end is something like facebook where very poor people your next door vendors are being helped by hni people by giving finance microfinance rather for running their own small businesses this is operating very successfully in kenya which is not typically a blockchain because its front end is being operated like a website and back end operates with a blockchain technology very successful operation this is that working paper i was talking about international monetary fund has very recently announced this working paper it's about one and a half months old where people are talking about central bank digital currency you may be knowing that attempts by libra that is facebook's critical currency digital currency or for that matter crypt cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ethereum if they allowed to proliferate the kind of people facebook are there if facebook starts a currency and if amazon kind of platforms allows that currency to be a currency for a business then central banks etc will lose their importance so these are the primary objectives and secondary objectives on one of the primary objective financial inclusion uh that means john you know which you are seeing physical banking today uh if cbdc comes in uh blockchain platform will be the platform for cbdc in fact uh two years before in a in a conference of delhi university i talked about cbdc and uh kovite 19 will definitely bring in proliferation of digital currency so this is a very important development so far as blockchain is concerned uh you can see the bank of france has appointed a fin finma uh registered that's a switzerland registered bank seba bank for starting a cbdc for france switzerland has already the switzerland has switzerland parliament has already approved a bill for uh proliferation of blockchain technology based digital cryptocurrency in switzerland this is a very interesting development in japan today if you buy from shopper stop for any goods or if you go by any airline you get certain gifts in the form of mileage point or or purchase gift you forget to in cash you don't keep track of all these things at times uh one year bad up up in the credit card with your gift one jama for your credit card use you also go to credit card to encourage it all these are not necessary every gift you get can be deposited to a blockchain based technology which every service provider may be a wildlands maybe any shopper's job may be chroma made by anybody if they participate in this particular digital platform all gifts can be centralized into one place and there can be a centralized usage of that you may be knowing the original partner of facebook that is visa and mastercard they have come out of libra and they are trying to start their own cryptocurrency i am at all not in favor of this this kind of cryptocurrencies is being started because i am always in favor of uh in favor of central bank digital currency this is russia russia has uh russia has started a blockchain based voting system uh this is they have just started the beauty of blockchain-based voting system will be not only voting uh by blockchain where no vote can be read but also a question in parliament about the well-being of his constituency he will be able to discuss through blockchain the proposal and he can also gather blockchain based opinion before raising it to parliament this is another another blockchain idea for protecting the rights of singers musicians and scriptwriters because today any song is available anywhere in the world you are essentially making use of this free but those are actually produced by somebody you are not paying it tomorrow you will not be able to do it if the blockchain is done blockchain is uh being uh has a we pro our own indian company has developed a blockchain based uh platform such central bank digital currency three countries switzerland gibraltar and uk has already uh tested blockchain based platform for running a stock exchange assume that bombay stock exchange or national stock exchange of india is being run by uh by a blockchain so that's not those days are not very far where you will be directly participating in buying and selling of shares you don't have to go to a broker you may of course take his consultation so coming to the conclusion point that [Music] before the contract part of it this is very important for you uh do you think that as if if a transaction is done in a blockchain technology based platform is it is it legally enforceable answer is yes any lawyer or any chartered accountant present who has got definitely knowledge of contract act you may know you may be knowing that unless these nine conditions are satisfied no contract if it is litigated can be taken to a court because the contract will be considered as bad white have issue so you will be definitely asking me dr basu if any blockchain transaction has to be done it has to be done with a legally signed contract essentially you are you are rest assured that a blockchain transaction only takes place on the basis of a smart contract which is already embedded in a blockchain platform and is very interesting news of course this news is more than two years old that the central bank of china sorry center supreme court of china has already accepted that any any records digital records and digital documents stored in a blockchain platform is legally acceptable to any court of law in china so the the highest populous country of the world has already given recognition to blockchain-based documents for blockchain markets blockchain operates on the basis of a smart contract i will urge upon you please read my paper on kishan because blockchain platform which i've already written and given for sharing with you all in a blockchain platform a contract is already embedded it's a pre-com compiled contract and it is digitally coded and it is embedded and this contract you have to sign before you enter into any transaction suppose you are in you are participating in an exim blockchain where there is a bank there is an importer there is an exporter there is a quality controller there is a shipping line there is a port there is a shipping agent uh and there is a there there is a banker every party is there so this blockchain platform will have a smart super smart contract which will first make you agree that you will be abiding by the guidelines of this contract and then each party with each party will enter into separate contracts for their separate transaction which will be a combination of contracts which will be available in this foreign platform you can say dr basu i tomorrow i can import from germany and after tomorrow i can export to us uh will it be will this blockchain platform take care of the laws of all the countries answer is yes because blockchain platform will definitely get into uh will have those smart contracts which are compliant pre-compliant contracts with various countries laws which are applicable to specific transactions work is being done i have had discussions with ibm microsoft people they are working on this kind of blockchain libraries and blockchain libraries which are already been created they are working on this methodology you can ask me another question that can one size fit all that means can one smart contract fit all types of transaction answer is no it cannot being a chartered accountant i cannot say that so there are flexibility available in this smart contracts what is this flexibility saying the flexibility says suppose if you want to amend three four five six of the clauses which of the smart contract available you can do an amendment scheduling that means you can propose your counterparty that these are the clauses i want to amend and these are my draft your counter party through blockchain platform says okay you have given the revised draft of these clauses i suppose i propose that this should be the revised up on the third revision of those clauses if people sign off that okay these are the amended clauses which are to be embedded so these amended clauses will be enforceable in the original smart contract which are already available in the library and these read with the original contract will be considered as the contract for ourselves and we sign off and that contract should be available in the smart contract library signed by you people in the system and definitely if you are having any dispute to be dragged to court of law you can direct to court of law using this digital smart contract so you are essentially today any contract you draft you go to a lawyer 10 different parties will go to 10 different lawyers will spend hours together in their chamber or in your office and created contract nothing is required so it is self-reliant it is trustworthy it is self-documented it is safely preserved it is backup evidence it has quickly authorized cost saved without any physical lawyer and regulation compliant so it's a very process very fast process it's a governed process it does not need any worries to be there of preserving the document because it is already preserved digitally in the smart contract library of the blockchain let me go back to my original so if if you see this dirty dozen of points you will find as an accountant a blockchain has got all the elements which are required for a commercial transaction to be commercially executed but through a p to p or e2e transaction p2p means people to people and e2e means enterprise to enterprise it has an embedded start contract it has got decentralized storage system or decentralized storage mechanism it is transparency but nobody knows you so it's called pseudonymity there is no central authority which controls the blockchain except the service provider who gives you the platform once the platform is given they don't have any control over you it is encrypted completely no transaction is digitally visible it is encrypted it is authenticated by more than one nodes that means the contract you are uh suppose you are entering into a import transaction where it will be financed by a uh by a buyer's credit uh so the buyer's credit provider bank you and the importer and the exporter of foreign country they will be signing actually tripartite contract it is filled into a chain of blocks uh it cannot be changed it has got algorithmic rules documents can be easily retrieved any document which you store in a black joint platform system it can be easily retraced and it's definitely not hackable that hacker has not been has not borne as yet and that computer of the hacker has not been created which can hack a block system so these are benefit blockchain system so this is the hardware business review suggestion that blockchain technology is not a disruptive technology it is a foundation foundational innovation it has it has the prospects to create new foundation for both economic and social structure of your country in 2017 uh a data was published by gartner which is the most uh most respected uh research organization in the world of its ict information communication technology uh madame uh madame and uh uh ca babisha i have to finish at six o'clock right yeah uh you you want to actually so uh the the kind of uh impact blockchain will create gartner has said by 2030 uh the whole world 3.1 trillion dollar savings will be done by blockchain which is called the value addition and in a in world economic forum a pwc report says that by 2027 10 of the world gdp will be hosted by blockchain that means if 2030 world gdp is expected to be 110 trillion dollar so by 27 it is expected that blockchain will hold transaction to the tune of 10 trillion dollar uh this is uh the humanities side of blockchain there's a gentleman called chris fabian uh he he was the chief foundation uh one of the chief of foundation of unicef he through his research all over the world by his team said that blockchain technology can reduce the poverty and the problems of impoverished children of poor countries blockchain can create change the identity management system the mexican and rohingya muslim problem would have not been there if blockchain technology would have been used for people identity management and of course funds transfer can be done by blockchain technology uh you can imagine uh how is the blockchain technology and by 2018 in a five years time 290 increase took place and 3.9 trillion billion has been invested by venture capital funds only for development of blockchain technology and that the in and beyond 2018 the in investment continues 2016 was the investment uh 2019 investment value was 3.08 trillion billion dollar so blockchain technology is being developed by investments uh uh blockchain ensure trust which i have already spoken so this slide did not be explained to you this is essentially a supply chain management and traditional versus blockchain benefit i come to a world level initiative which i found in russia a russian organization called international decentralized association for cryptocurrency and blockchain da idscb they are trying to work with 95 countries of the world to develop the best practices of different countries and best regulations of the different countries to bring an internationally acceptable code for blockchain contracts this is an this is a very interesting initiative of ibm ibm says that all your individual blockchain platform need not have a kyc or kyp system i am going to give you a kyc and qip system which can be used up by you for your blockchain platform so if you can avoid kyc and kyp system in your blockchain platform and use decentralized platform it will be further more cost effective one of the most important uh adoption challenges non availability of skill another challenge is energy consumption this challenge of course is there for used to be there for bitcoin and ethereum now that the constant system is reducing so computer time used for one transaction will be reduced and that much electricity will be less redu less consumed so blockchain technology will be definitely more and more electricity uh less consuming system and the carbon footprint will definitely reduce but you can imagine you will use the reduced work and if distributed work reduces collectively you will save lot of electricity another important point is blockchain technology is scalability so uh now scalability is being solved so blockchain technology is more and more becoming a doable technology uh let me tell you one thing indians believe in zugar for circumventing any problem indians believe in zugar for circumventing any problem these 10 points which have listed here are the challenges of blockchain technology zugar will not work in blockchain technology neither you can break nor you can bypass nor you can overpass blockchain technology will solve the problems for all this all these things these are the governance rules of blockchain technology these are the ten points agenda for governance minimize trust uh don't believe anybody blockchain doesn't believe anybody it believes its own system is an immutable pro protocol it is funchable it is final there is no sensorship required no central authority there is no permission required no reconciliation required all transactions are online there is no authoritative control required of the developers because it is essentially it is decentralized control and all regulatory principles and governance principles are pre-complied in a blockchain technology uh i will share with you a very small point uh before i go to my next volume uh how do you test whether a blockchain technology is required by your client einstein young has developed a very interesting questionnaire and if out of these five questions three questions answered is yes then a blockchain technology is required by your client first question is are there multiple parties establishing trust between multiple parties is it an issue that your process and system doesn't establish tasks is it critical to have detailed transactional record for every transaction you create whether record keeping is important uh uh are you securing ownership or management of finite source all the data are from one finite source and does the network of partners benefit from the increased transparency that means the system you follow does it require transparency today the banking platform which you used i am telling you that it's not fully transparent it may be secured but it's not fully transparent so if out of these five questions three questions are answered in yes you can tell that blockchain platform is the required platform for your client this is a mackenzie study mackenzie has busted five myths about blockchain and and and if you study this you will find that blockchain people are having a broad misunderstanding about blockchain and blockchain is definitely the right ticked item on technology for your client rest i will not discuss here because you know i'll go to my next volume for talking about something on volume 2 essentially i'll keep skipping because you have essentially understood the preliminaries of blockchain technology i'll only talk about the slides which are required for you uh we appreciate that blockchain technology has not come up with a popular public platform that's why people's perception about blockchain is equal to bitcoin but definitely a lot of applications you will see soon i'll tell you one thing that the world is divided about what is a cryptocurrency uh this is an us-based uh study where a security exchange commission in us called a cryptocurrency a security uh the cftc that is commodity futures trading commission of america called cryptocurrency a property the financial crime enforcement center which is one of the most important critical agencies of america called blockchain currency and the irs internal revenue system called blockchain a property if you if it is a property you pay stamp duty if it is a currency central bank should operate it if it is a property you pay this thing if you if it is a security you pay in security transaction tax and different platforms are required so world is divided about blockchain so one world has to functionally and accept one currency so cryptocurrency is acceptance around the world by the time it comes i believe that central bank digital currency will come these are the some of the use cases of blockchain i don't want to discuss those in detail this is important pwc and world economic forum has said that 82 different types of latino natural calamities can be controlled and reduced by blockchain uh this is the football club of madrid who placed pace to their players and controls their gulligan supporters through blockchain platform this is american novel uh spare parts management system through blockchain this is the track and trace your talk i was talking about you can know which uh bell paper right uh fruit or which brinjal was produced by which farmer in which gps position uh this was i was talking to you uh certain initiatives let me kill initiatives uh this is the country chile chile wants to use blockchain platform for giving services to their countrymen seven mediterranean countries wants to use blockchain platform for their service to their people now audit in a blockchain platform this is important for you this is the rick's universe which you know uh uh all of you know i do i don't need to sell ice to a skimmers chartered accountants knows the financial risk all types of risk now let me fathom you and tell you that all these risks are possible almost all the risks are possible to be mitigated by use of blockchain platform except for leadership risk that is decision oriented risk though which are dependent on people's personal skill those cannot be done but definitely rest of this one of the important this can be done definitely many other things can be done so uh in taiwan city in in 2018 july uh deloitte ey kpmg and pwc no names to you uh they have converged for 20 banks to study how the banking system can be audited so uh deloitte concluded the traditional framework of risk management which you are seeing in this slide which are embedded in their standard of auditing which are embedded for ifc for fr ifcfr internal financial control for financial reporting with section 134 section 147 and section 177 of the indian companies act that can be that can be and through blockchain so whatever data is generated from blockchain technology those will be ifcfr compliant this slide is very important for you friends this is the pwc's uh uh research pw says she says that there is no standard way to validate a blockchain platform because each blockchain is unique having their own unit architecture and no blockchain is standardized except for the contract element in it it has got a customized designed and customized control environment and uh if you as an auditor do not have knowledge and insight about the blockchain platform and for that matter many employees of the organization may not have full knowledge and training about a blockchain platform you will be suffering so traditional audit techniques cannot be applied to a blockchain platform so pwc came up with the conclusion that if transactions are transacted in a blockchain environment those have to be real-time real-time auditing with a tool and i am aware of uh i have got their literature with me which tool takes care of this it's a real-time auditing tool it is it can be built into any blockchain platform that means it can it can be embedded it can it can audit immediate transaction and through data analysis it can do some prediction about shape of things to come in future transaction it can do full population audit it can do macro level transporting that means it can identify a very odd transaction in the system and suppose one insurance every insurance premium you charge point three percent or three uh per milli rupees three per milli somebody has charged 10 per milli you can detect that particular transaction so a digital distributed ledger technology has to be audited by a different kind of a tool and pwc has already come up with tool anstenia has also come up with a tool but that particular tool is only for and is working on this apng is said will be using cognitively cognitive technology means ai based technology for doing blockchain based audit uh so uh except for pwci my knowledge says that there is not much of development as yet so whatever you do uh blockchain technology has to take care of uh this kind of risk you cannot have safety pin technology you cannot have it unstructured and you cannot have only the front end protected you have to take care of the most weak link in the chain blockchain technology can do everything of this now let me come to the last dimension of my discussion and i'll be and he says i slept and dreamt and this is equally applicable for chartered accountants profession without blockchain technology without digital technology only see a profession i slept and dreamt that life was joy i slept and dreamt that life was joy i evoked and saw that life was service i acted and behold that service was joy that means you must you must have your joy by giving service to humanity that's the most important part of your life unless if you have an only money motive to give service to humanity then you are not enjoying the world of service and that is what is the basis and this is what i spoke in moscow i spoke in i introduced the 70s and 7ps in moscow and it was very well received by the russians of course we have interpreters from english to russian i said that technology doesn't have morality emotion and ethics technology doesn't have morality emotion and ethics value generation skill of its own but the technologists have those so success of blockchain will depend on these human qualities of solution builders leaving least scope for the users to deploy against humanity that means the technologists who will design the blockchain platforms and the people who will design the smart can smart contracts it will lie on them the success of blockchain technology will lie on them that is the beauty i'm talking about and this is my my this is my portion of this is my message to the entire community of blockchain technologist and my suggestion that you follow 70s and those 70s are technology talent truth trust transparency tenacity and timeline i repeat technology talent truth trust transparency tenacity and timeline and seven ps for becoming successful with any technology it is people patience passion perseverance piety purity and penance so blockchain technology can be a dulling of the mass if it is based on universal or truism blockchain technology has to have sustainable shared values if you save money by applying technology please pass it on to your price of product and service because you need to have inclusive happiness you you can save and you cannot entirely earn that profit you have to share with people that normally you will have inclusive happiness and blockchain technology has to surprise www www cross geographical boundaries that means you can send a mail to america without american postal services you have www that means internet will do that job blockchain technology has to transcend the political boundaries it cannot have its own ism only ism of it would be the people of world that means humanity and i have suggested in america and dubai that humanity is one and the world is its home and the need of a global regulatory body i've already suggested that blockchain technology or for that matter uh artificial intelligence or whatever technology digital you use it should be under the supervision and broad guidelines of a central authority like imf has used for digital currency uh these are the awh principles of solution building i don't want to discuss this this is mainly for coders uh this is dr portuguese versus own creation you will not find this in any book of the world i apply this for management studies also awh principles of solidification building so this slide is important for you blockchain believes in one single version of truth and is built on the foundation of trust one single version of truth truth can be having one single version and one single version can only be trusted what you what you trust is not necessarily true and what is true is not necessarily what you trust so what has to be truth has to be trusted what can be trusted has to be true and blockchain has only one version of truth uh i do not want to discuss this because industry 5 you know these are my friends this is my last slide for the day this is my 10 commandments for digital transformation and and with this i will end my discussion humanity first humanity first redistribute power reduce complexities re-imagine consumption go for creative destruction manage climate emergency be accountable without discrimination fix imbalance of humanity and technology i repeat fixed imbalance of humanity and technology today [Music] and doesn't have technology you reach it there and i believe our government is working for that enhanced technology with universal altruism everybody should be benefited for every technology you offered to the society not the only hnis or middle class let imagination safety and ethics let imagination safety and ethics lead transformation don't challenge your limits limit your challenges and finally my my hero apj abdul kalam said a vision is not a project report or a plan or a target it is an articulation of a desired and result in broader terms so i stopped my presentation here come back to the audience and any question if i have the capability i will handle is thank you for the nice presentation it is great to hear you sir there are a few questions i to requested his screen and uh so that uh so can see the questions one by one and can answer the questions uh thank you so much for so much of support uh and i am so happy that you people are listening to me i am feeling blessed and privileged okay let me stake up the question one by one uh how will the blockchain technology affect the sme small and medium enterprises let me tell you one thing smaller than small and medium enterprises are the startups and you are talking about sme started accountant firms sme chartered accountant firms they can partner with startups and develop unique blockchain solutions because there is no doubt of problems in our society so if you are having imagination as i told bhagavad-gita and einstein has told us imagination will drive the next century if you can develop solutions people have minted billions of dollars by simply developing a solution so please develop solutions and offer a platform of those solutions to your clients it need not be that your individual people individual uh client has to uh uh have an individual solution for the blockchain platform you partner with uh startup there is no doubt of startups in india develop solutions and you you offered those solutions with clients you will definitely be able to benefit not only deep benefit to your clients you will also get benefit next question is what and how can we learn about blockchain so that we can be abreast of the development are there any credible courses of the blockchain technology plenty of courses are there in kerala we have a blockchain academy iim calcutta runs a blockchain program uh every if you search google uncle uh you will get 10 different institutions running a blockchain platform program so kerala blockchain academy is good iim calcutta is good uh i believe some of the universities have started dui patil dui patil in bombay has started some blockchain technology platform and institution to teach so you can try those how costly it is to migrate to blockchain technology in banking industry how much capital and recurring cost for maintenance of this system is the technology let me take let me tell you blockchain technology will be first applied to banking industry and i am presently studying along with a professor of nibm puna about the transformation of blockchain technology about digital transformation where all the types of technology tools are used i believe blockchain is one of their top of the agenda let me tell you application of blockchain technology is not very expensive neither it is very expensive to develop a blockchain platform what is expensive is to develop this smart contract because lot of inputs have to go there once it is developed and deployed people have to have their faith and belief to start operating like originally you used to be very skeptical of sharing of your information when internet surgery i remember when a computer came in banks in 1970s and 80s everybody was skeptical now it is a it is a part of your life similarly days are not very far that blockchain will be a part of your life let me tell you blocked any any technology development except scalability management i repeat it is except scalability management that means more the value volume more the capacity to be increased uh blockchain technology hardly have any maintenance cost it is equal to version change as you have in sap or anything the code portion of blockchain technology is not very heavy what is important is smart contract and gaining people to participate but one thing is very important that is kyc know your customer or kyp know your participant uh if if government of india can develop a central agency like i showed you for ibm for doing a central kyp or kyc which is not only applicable for individual citizens but also applicable for individual entities maybe a sole proprietorship or a partnership or a limited company who will be a participant then uh application of blockchain will not be very expensive any other technology whatever maintenance cost you spend that will be the same cost for blockchain also however this technology is used in india let me tell you quite little only banks are using a bet uh it is not as of now it has not gained a lot of momentum as we expect it to get but blockchain is a slow starter but lots and lots of applications have already been tested and waiting for wide scale application like government of india has already done along with three banks visa bank of india a cryptocurrency blockchain platform which they are now naming as cbdr central bank digital rupee it is a blockchain based application that that is is is being uh public will be publicly debated soon like as supreme court of india is now examining the uh the uh the proposal for appointing blockchain-based technology for record management many universities of india are working on credentials management using blockchain technology so it has started gaining momentum but it will take a bit of a time but once it gathers critical mass i believe it will grow faster can this system uh is substitute for sap system uh it's a very interesting question very very interesting question i can say that blockchain tech sap is trying to make their technology as capable as blockchain technology but that will not be possible because sap is not based on distributed technology but sap and blockchain can be friendly technologies each can talk to each one and you can simultaneously apply blockchain technology with sap how this technology will be beneficial to auditors the first important benefit you will get is that you will be able to base your opinion on 100 transaction checking and uh and very interestingly you will be doing online transaction taking checking as i showed you the pwc paper uh that you will be able to also do a trend analysis using this tool of course you have to have that tool i will personally urge upon my chartered account and friends who are very good in auditing both internal auditing and statutory auditing why don't you join certain startup uh to develop a blockchain based auditing tool which pwc worldwide is working on and but has been successful already sir please explain why the blockchain system will help smes clients who are mostly audited or served by small practitioners let me tell you first first allow the smes to adopt blockchain technology and let me tell you one thing in a blockchain based services blockchain based services smes saps will be the most benefited group of people because blockchain will be able to reduce law a lot of your cost you will be saving a lot of lawyers costs lot of transaction costs lot of banking costs uh i do not know whether i will leave out in those days but i am sure my prophecy is seven to ten years from now blockchain technology will be a network for smes only i believe some blockchain from sf some saps have already participated in trade finance uh platforms so hopefully it will take a bit of a time but definitely it will be a success in future moreover think of us we are on a awareness generation session today if three of us or ten of us work with startups to provide some blockchain platforms for saps smes suppose i have already suggested in a chartered accountants forum that we should have a blockchain based key mondays suppose uh smes by various commodities like steel aluminum copper and metals why not a blockchain based metal budget why not a blockchain based finish boots buzzer a blockchain based trading platform for their harvest so uh initiatives are started as you know in india things move slow and i am very very hopeful that things will start and chartered accountants first before reaping the benefit first contribute when i say contribute means first develop the startups to develop various blockchain-based solution platforms once a solution platforms are developed with a joint initiative being mentored to a startup be a participant to a startup be an angel financer today startup develop good solutions by using blockchain and develop good solution for infusion of blockchain artificial intelligence iots etc then only we can think of benefit let us create the solution first then the benefit will come but i'm sure as you have seen that the prediction is 3.1 trillion dollar will be the value edition by blockchain technology by 2027 and definitely all of us will be the beneficiary of that because blockchain technology is based on universal altruism i hope i have handled all the questions thank you sir uh very informative session and a lot of awareness will be uh there uh with the members if it's an era of uh technology can we take out this particular question paper please if anybody wants to raise a face-to-face question you can take the benefit or of course we have four minutes left we can take out this slide show uh the word document okay thank you yeah participants if uh anyone wants to ask any question then we can take one or two questions we need a detailed session may be running into three or four sessions like this then only people will develop the confidence yes it is workable we need it and it will be useful to us that's the only suggestion sir not a query yeah we will take a note of it please please thank you yeah thank you thank you for your sir success question is how would this help us uh small enterprises because first of all we need to have knowledge about the blockchain technology because uh you know i don't think even the curriculum ca curriculum has any uh study regarding blockchain technology so how would vca be capable of handling all these things that is uh we have to take it forward through this study circle to this western indian regional council let me tell you one thing i am a member of the study board of another institute of which i'm a member and uh they are actively working on this digital transformation as one of their advanced study area and i'm sure time is not very far which ca institute also include may not be as a main curriculum but as an advanced study curriculum for cs to pursue this after the uh after qualifying as a startup accountant so your talk was very important yes i did my diploma so it was talk was very enlightening sir at least we have some uh starting point from somewhere so thank you so much thank you so much i will arch upon you please read my papers it will be much more clear thank you so is an era of much and the project blockchain technology is useful in many areas you explain a lot of things regarding the blockchain and in the coming years blockchain technology will help us uh and we have to be uh uh aware of the technology i now request to present a book of thanks to the speaker it was a really pleasure listening to you sir you have dealt with all aspects of black blockchain right from history statistics present and even futurity solutions in details with so many used and use case examples all over the world including india all this information is very useful to us and has given us this perspective of the changing change happening around us and that jugaad hopefully would now be eliminated slowly but surely i thank you sir for your time and expertise and i thank you on behalf of jb naga study circle thank you so much i am grateful to jb study circle committee for giving me this opportunity and has shared my thoughts with my colleagues in the profession uh i'm i i'll be happy to participate in future thank you so much sir thank you so much"}]
