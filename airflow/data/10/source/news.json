BCG Platinion and Crypto.com weigh up the centralised versus decentralised finance debate.\n\nDecentralised finance \u2013 or DeFi as the researchers call it \u2013 is explained in the report as: \u201cFinancial services that are built on public blockchains and based on open protocols and decentralised applications (dApps), allowing all aspects of the platform to be automated and performed without a central authority or intermediary.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversely traditional finance relies on intermediaries and centralised institutions.\u201d As it stands, these centralised bodies exert tight control on financial activity, with strict conditions on who can access funding and how. Well suited for the wealthy, the system has grown to leave a range of low-income entrepreneurs and SMEs out in the cold.\n\nThe researchers revealed that Europe is home to 24 million SMEs that contribut over \u20ac7 trillion to the region\u2019s economy. Still, the risk profile attached with startups and small businesses has combined with high regulatory credit thresholds to push European SMEs and startups away from banks and towards investors.\n\nMany position DeFi as a solution to this problem. Expert principal at BCG Platinion in Amsterdam Igor Mikhalev elaborated. \u201cBy removing the intermediary and automating many functions, DeFi can provide lower costs, higher degrees of security and privacy, resist censorship, increase accessibility and promote a decision-making democracy.\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, loans, deposits, savings and investments become a reality for thousands who cannot satisfy mainstream financial conditions. And many have realised this. DeFI platforms are coming up in droves, and are finding solutions that enable financial accessibility. Trudging along below the $2 billion mark till last year, the value of DeFi assets has surged to nearly $10 billion since the start of this year.\n\nNaturally, there are those who doubt the potential of DeFi. Experts point to nearly $2 billion that the world of financial services has channeled into blockchain without returns of any significance \u2013 barring unstable Bitcoin investments. There are few reasons to believe that the blockchain technology could generate any real value for other players, given the high costs associated with its implementation.\n\nAdd to this the fact that DeFi remains an immature market, with poor security protocols, regulatory ambiguity a distinct lack of liquidity. Further evidence of immaturity is that most of DeFi tends to revolve around a single network \u2013 Ethereum. All these factors explain the apprehension around DeFi \u2013 termed by the researchers as \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d\n\nDeFi's disruptive potential\n\nThat being said, BCG Platinon and Crypto.com note how DeFi could be tremendously disruptive if it can navigate these growing pains. In fact, the new paradigm could hit centralised finance where it hurts the most \u2013 payments and lending.\n\nBy this point, most consumers around Europe and other developed markets have come to take contactless payments, mobile wallets and money transfers for granted. By contrast, in the developing world, many countries are still struggling with financial inclusivity. Millions of financially eligible people are yet to have a bank account, let alone digital payments infrastructure.\n\nCryptocurrency famously offers financial inclusivity by facilitating anonymous transactions from one part of the world to another. Even in the developed world, some transactions can take up to three days to get regulatory and procedural clearance, while most transactions are subject to a transfer fee. DeFi is built with the intention of eliminating these intermediary charges and speeding up the process.\n\nThen there is DeFi\u2019s disruptive potential in the lending landscape, where it can add value for lenders and borrowers alike. For borrowers, the appeal lies in the absence of credit checks and \u2018know-your-customer\u2019 practices, as well as in low, personalised and flexible interest rates.\n\nFor lenders, there is a chance to retain a bigger share of the interest. Mikhalev explained: The value extracted by banks in traditional lending significantly outpaces the level seen in DeFi lending protocols. The main reason for this is that banks incur significant labour costs for its operations and they are able to extract higher economic rents due to their central position, while decentralised lending protocols have minimal ongoing costs, with the only cost being to compensate governance token holders for carrying out their functions.\u201d\n\nIt is no secret that Europe\u2019s banking sector has been under pressure in recent years. Regulatory changes, low interest rates and the tendency to save are putting a squeeze on earnings. As a range of smaller tech-based players look to pounce on this vulnerability, DeFi might just find its foot in the door of mainstream financial services."}, {"title": "Crypto.com and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Release New Report on Decentralized Finance (DeFi)", "link": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cryptocom-and-boston-consulting-group-bcg-release-new-report-on-decentralized-finance-defi-301126901.html", "date": "None", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "['today', 'bcg', 'group', 'decentralized', 'financial', 'cryptocom', 'finance', 'consulting', 'services', 'release', 'boston', 'industry', 'report', 'defi']", "summary": "HONG KONG, Sept. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) growth has been explosive.\nAs analysts question how disruptive it will be to traditional finance, Crypto.com and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), have today, released a joint research report weighing the implications DeFi will have on centralised finance.\nDeFi's proponents expect a disruption of mainstream financial services by allowing all aspects of financial services to be automated and performed by anyone, without a central authority or intermediary.\nFind out more by visiting https://crypto.comAbout BCG PlatinionAs a part of Boston Consulting Group (BCG), BCG Platinion provides consulting services in design, development and implementation of advanced technology solutions that fuel creation of new-generation business models.\nAbout Boston Consulting GroupBoston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities.", "text": "HONG KONG, Sept. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) growth has been explosive.

DeFi's proponents expect a disruption of mainstream financial services by allowing all aspects of financial services to be automated and performed by anyone, without a central authority or intermediary. The report tempers the anticipated potential of DeFi with an honest assessment of current challenges facing the industry and the underlying technology.\n\nRegulation and governance have given the centralised finance (CeFi) industry an enormous proportion of the value generated from financial services. While DeFi may be perceived as a threat to CeFi, Crypto.com and BCG's report offers a roadmap for financial services leaders to build a new generation of politically and technologically resilient financial solutions that are extremely valuable and more relevant in today's digital economy.\n\nKris Marszalek, Co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com said: \"Our joint research into DeFi provides a deep dive into the reasons behind its growth, differentiators against CeFi and its potential to disrupt mainstream finance.

That means that only some onramps to convert fiat to cryptocurrencies are governed by anti money laundering rules. Once the user holds the cryptocurrency, there are few restrictions.\n\nBCG says with the centralized financial (CeFi) system, SMEs often present a poor risk-return profile to banks in part because they fail regulatory checks. As a result, SMEs have less access to finance and where they can get loans, it\u2019s expensive.\n\n\u201cThe next wave of demand for capital and financial services will stem from emerging economies and an SME industry underserved by traditional finance,\u201d the report says after noting incumbent banks\u2019 rent-seeking behavior.\n\nLikewise, for the underbanked, \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) and \u201cAnti-Money Laundering\u201d (AML) processes lock out parts of the population. The World Bank puts the figure at $380 billion.\n\nThe challenges\n\nThe report highlights some of the challenges of DeFi. These include poor current scalability of permissionless networks and high network usage fees. Despite significant growth since June, current DeFi funds available stand at $9.5 billion, which is just a fraction of cyrptocurrency market capitalization of $275 billion. As a result, there\u2019s still limited liquidity.\n\nSmart contracts that automate the DeFi processes occasionally have security vulnerabilities that can cost the users their funds. Unlike centralized finance, there is no recourse and there are often scams.\n\nIn reality, many of the participants are relatively wealthy. This contrasts with the third world underbanked that the permissionless system theoretically could help. Part of the reason is to participate in the lending system requires over collaterization.\n\nThe Ethereum network is currently the dominant network for DeFi. As a result, if there are technical issues such as network bugs or congestion, this represents a risk to the entire system.\n\nA major question is what might happen in terms of regulation. Will the onramp KYC/AML compliance suffice? Or will regulators seek to make the trading more permissioned?\n\nThe paper says that, for now, according to FATF rules, most DeFi is in the clear. If a DeFi protocol is sufficiently decentralized and an entity is not involved in everyday operations, it won\u2019t be classified as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). Hence doesn\u2019t have to comply with the Travel Rule.\n\nDisruption potential\n\nThe paper then explores the three areas of payments, lending and exchanges. With payments, it points to low potential transaction costs because there are fewer intermediaries than card transactions. Plus, there is no scope for chargebacks, which is both a pro and con, depending on your perspective. The report highlights opportunities in some regions such as APAC, LATAM and Africa where there is limited card penetration.\n\nTurning to lending, the difference in models in centralized versus decentralized finance are explored. For example, in DeFi, lending rates are dynamic depending on the cash available in a pool. If the pool of capital is almost lent up to its limit, the rate becomes high, including for those who have already taken out loans. Because lending is collateralized by depositing cryptocurrency, there is no need for credit checks or KYC. And on that point, because there is no KYC there is no cost associated with that and overheads are limited. Hence, up to 95% of the interest paid by borrowers is passed on to lenders.\n\nThe third application explored is exchanges. While there are order book based decentralized exchanges, the most popular ones don\u2019t use order books and the market making is automated. Instead, there are pools of liquidity provided by users and traders can buy and sell based on the liquidity provided.\n\nThe rest of the paper explores decentralized governance, which is like a more active version of shareholder voting. And an overview of how incumbents might get involved.\n\nBoston Consulting Group explores DeFi, blockchain financeBCG has been fairly active in the blockchain space. It has a digital venture arm that was involved in the De Beers TRACR blockchain diamond tracing solution.

This could mean purchasing items made sustainably, or only shopping with brands committed to ethical working practices. As consumers are more aware than ever about the impact of their buying habits, sellers have to accommodate this shift in consumer behavior by changing the way they operate.\n\nOne industry where this is particularly noticeable is the diamond sector. Demand for ethical diamonds has skyrocketed in recent years, due to the fact consumers don\u2019t want to pay for a gemstone being used to finance wars, insurgencies or oppressive regimes, especially in Africa. So-called blood diamonds have long been a major issue for the industry, even with measures like the Kimberley Process in place, which aims to prevent \u2018conflict diamonds\u2019 from entering the mainstream rough diamond market.\n\nAlthough some producers have turned to lab-grown diamonds instead, those continuing to sell natural jewels have had to think about how to guarantee the integrity of their products. One solution the industry is looking towards is blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is blockchain technology?\n\nBlockchain is a form of digital technology that enables the distribution of data that resists modification. A blockchain works as a time-stamped series of data records (blocks) managed by a group of computers, not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks is secure and bound to one another using cryptography (i.e. the chain in \u2018blockchain\u2019), a series of mathematical equations (algorithms) and secret keys that encrypt the data. This chain cannot be altered, thus acting as a secure means of transferring and storing data. In addition, because a blockchain is not centrally-owned, the information it contains is open for anyone to see, and much harder to hack. Blockchains tend to store data like transactions (such as between a diamond miner and cutter), including the date, time and value of any money exchanged, as well as information about who is participating in the transaction.\n\nIn order for a block to be added to the blockchain, a transaction must occur. It then needs to be verified, with the network of computers confirming that the transaction happened in the way the parties said it did. It is then stored in a block, which is given a hash, a unique, cryptographic code distinguishing the block from others. At this point, the block can be added to the blockchain and publicly viewed by anyone. Each computer involved in the blockchain network gets its own identical copy of the blockchain, which makes it even harder to infiltrate. This is why blockchains are often referred to as distributed ledgers.\n\nHow can blockchain guarantee ethical diamonds?\n\nTracking the origin and authenticity of a diamond is a hugely difficult task. The industry\u2019s complex supply chain means that gemstones are often mined in countries like Africa, Russia and Canada, then cut in places such as India, Belgium and Israel before being shipped to wherever they\u2019re sold. As such, they typically touch numerous hands before reaching consumers. It\u2019s even harder to ascertain a diamond\u2019s provenance when the details are traditionally documented on paper or PDFs, records which are open to forgery and therefore may not give a truly accurate account of where a gemstone has come from, or if it\u2019s even a genuine diamond.\n\nHowever, using blockchain technology means the data cannot be altered, so a diamond\u2019s journey can accurately be documented from beginning to end. As a public record accessible to anyone, consumers can turn to blockchain to confirm that a diamond has been produced in an ethical way and not sold for unethical reasons. Over the last few years, this technology has proven valuable in winning over conscious consumers concerned by the potentially unethical provenance of their products.\n\nHow are diamond companies harnessing blockchain?\n\nNumerous blockchain solutions have been aimed at diamond companies in recent years, including one courtesy of perhaps the biggest name within the industry itself: De Beers. Back in 2018, the behemoth revealed plans for Tracr, a blockchain using the Ethereum platform that was developed alongside Boston Consulting Group\u2019s Digital Ventures and five leading diamond manufacturers. Diamonds must be scanned at every stage of the production and distribution process so all the data can be entered into the blockchain to track the journey accurately. Every diamond is also assigned a Global Diamond ID, a digital record showing its key attributes such as carat, clarity and color. This can then be used to verify its authenticity and can then be shared with customers in a store so they understand exactly what they are buying.\n\nAnother company harnessing blockchain technology for similar purposes is IBM, which has developed the TrustChain tool alongside five leading jewelry makers. \u201cBy placing the current, physical process on a blockchain, we provide better visibility to the consumer throughout the entire supply chain, to allow exchanges of information amongst participants,\u201d the initiative\u2019s website states.\n\nAnother example is Everledger, a relatively new blockchain technology making inroads in the jewelry industry. Luxury jeweler Taylor & Hart uses Everledger to monitor its own supply chain, citing the elimination of paper-based reporting in favor of smart digital contracts as a key benefit\u2014simultaneously eliminating the risk of tampering.\n\nCould this pave the way for an ethical diamond industry?\n\nBlockchain technology is clearly a very promising tool for dealing with forgery and helping prove a diamond\u2019s provenance at every stage of the process. This can lead to a more ethical industry overall, as those selling and buying diamonds can have more confidence in where their products have come from.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to be realistic about how much change blockchain can actually drive. As argued by Everledger founder Leanne Kemp, there will always be potential for fraud and the existence of black market diamonds. Furthermore, blockchain can only make the diamond industry more ethical if companies actually use it. Although bigger businesses are harnessing the technology, there are plenty of smaller ones which are much less likely to understand blockchain or have the funds to implement it.\n\nNevertheless, blockchain technology can certainly help make the diamond industry more transparent, and if used more widely, could almost certainly contribute to a more ethical future for the world\u2019s favorite gemstone.\n\nNikolay Piriankov, co-founder and CEO, Taylor & Hart"}, {"title": "French blockchain firms offer tracing for Swiss watches", "link": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-blockchain-firms-offer-tracing-for-swiss-watches/46179810", "date": "None", "authors": "['\u00dcbertragung Aus Dem Franz\u00f6sischen', 'Rita Emch', 'Samuel Jaberg', 'Journalist', 'Deputy Head Of The Swissinfo.Ch Editorial Group For German', 'French', 'Italian.

Andrew Poplavsky\n\nThe market for second-hand luxury watches is booming. But for the average consumer, it is not easy to tell a fake from the genuine article and determine the real value of a particular timepiece. Certificates based on blockchain technology could provide more transparency.\n\nThis content was published on November 24, 2020 - 11:00\n\nSamuel Jaberg\n\nJournalist and deputy head of the swissinfo.ch editorial group for German, French and Italian. Earlier, worked for Teletext and Switzerland\u2019s French-language national broadcaster. More about the author | French Department\n\nWatch fans who want to get the new diving watch by Rolex had better be patient. The official resellers of the famous brand with the crown logo always give the same answer: launched this autumn, the latest version of the iconic timepiece will not be available in the shops for a few years yet.\n\nThere is already a long waiting list, and shortages are carefully managed, in accordance with the golden rule of luxury marketing: rarity increases desirability. Patek Philippe\u2019s Nautilus model certainly holds the record for the watch in greatest demand ever: would-be customers need to wait 11 years in the hope of one day getting their hands on this holy grail of the watchmaker\u2019s craft.\n\nConsequently, the price of these collector\u2019s items is climbing steeply on the second-hand luxury watches market, which is currently quite hot. According to a recent study by Boston Consulting Group, the world market for second-hand watches is currently worth CHF16 billion ($17.5 billion) and should enjoy an average annual growth of 8% between now and 2025. In comparison, total sales of new watches are estimated at CHF50 billion per year.\n\nSecurity needs on the web\n\nThe study shows that most watch fans are open to buying a luxury product second-hand. However, they also have \u201cclear expectations as regards purchasing security, convenience and service\u201d. Given that there is a grey market out there where counterfeits and false claims abound, traceability is becoming a key feature in the strategy of the brands.\n\nOne solution could come from blockchain technology for the decentralised storage and transmission of information, which has been in vogue these past few years. \u201cBlockchain means that you can issue a unique digital certificate, which cannot be counterfeited or duplicated, and it is ultra-secure for every watch. It\u2019s the ultimate solution in the fight against fakes\u201d, says Loys de La Soudi\u00e8re, co-founder of GoodsID.\n\nLoys de La Soudi\u00e8re, founder of GoodsID. Lavieille Philippe/le Parisien / Lavieille Philippe\n\nFor the past three years this French start-up has been developing certificates of authenticity based on blockchain technology for the luxury industry. In 2018, GoodsID was able to secure investment funds of \u20ac1million from the private sector and the French Public Investment Bank (BPI) in order to carry out this development work.\n\nSwiss watchmakers are a priority market for GoodsID. The start-up recently opened an office in Biel/Bienne, the watchmaking centre in canton Bern, to approach the main Swiss companies in the field. \u201cWe are holding advanced negotiations with two major brands, and we hope they will decide to go for our solution in the next few months,\" says La Soudi\u00e8re.\n\nDigital revolution\n\nThe increased popularity of online shopping, which has only been boosted by the coronavirus situation, is quickly changing ways of thinking in the watchmaking industry, which has the reputation of being conservative and not very open to \u201cdigital disruption\u201d.\n\nIn mid-October, Breitling announced that it was going to issue an encrypted passport for each of its new watches, thus making obsolete the paper certificate of authenticity used up until now.\n\nThis watch brand, which specialises in aviators\u2019 watches, decided to partner with Arianee, a French non-profit consortium which aims to set up an independent world standard for digital certification of high-priced goods.\n\nThe watches in Vacheron Constantin's \"Les Collectionneurs\" collection have been digitally certified using blockchain technology since May 2019. Keystone\n\nAdvantages of blockchain\n\nApart from guaranteeing security and traceability, digital certificates using blockchain technology allow watch brands to take a very precisely targeted marketing approach. \u201cWhen a sale takes place on the second-hand market, the watchmaker that made the product originally can send a notification to the new purchaser providing hints for maintenance or suggesting they explore the world of the brand in one of its retail outlets. So it can use the product as a communication tool\u201d, says La Soudi\u00e8re.\n\nWith one click, the new owner of the watch can certify the ownership and authenticity of the item, which maximises its value on the second-hand market. Finally, the digital certificate simplifies claims on the guarantee, and can also be considered a kind of insurance against theft.\n\nAll these advantages are prompting industry experts to say that blockchain technology may become routine in Swiss watchmaking. \u201cThe Swiss manufacturers are beginning to realise that it\u2019s in their interest to be able to identify their products using modern technology. It\u2019s a positive development\u201d, says Michel Arnoux, who is head of the anti-counterfeit department of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\nFakes just keep coming\n\nSeveral companies active in the field of digital certification have been courting the Federation in the hope that their solution might be adopted as a standard for the whole Swiss industry. \u201cAt the moment, this is a matter for each individual watch brand\u201d, Arnoux points out, however. \u201cThere is no legal mechanism whereby one single standard could be imposed.\u201d\n\nAll hopes should not be placed in blockchain technology, either, Arnoux adds. \u201cCertification of authentic products is intended to reassure the customer. To think this technology would put an end to counterfeiting is an illusion\u201d, he says. Most people buying fake Swiss watches are quite aware of what they are doing and have no interest in certification.\n\nThe counterfeit market just keeps growing, in marked contrast with the unprecedented slump being experienced by the Swiss watch industry. Seizures of fake watches by Swiss customs have increased 25% this year already, and at the present time, almost twice the number of fake watches are sold around the world as real ones, the Federation states.\n\nArnoux sums it up: \u201cWith all the lockdowns in different countries, consumers have had plenty of time to surf the internet looking for fakes that cost a lot less than original Swiss watches \u2013 which are often out of reach for the average buyer.\u201d\n\nTranslated from French by Terence MacNamee"}, {"title": "Crypto.com and BCG Platinion's report on DeFi -", "link": "https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2020/09/18/crypto-com-and-bcg-platinions-report-on-defi/", "date": "2020-09-18 00:00:00", "authors": "['Charles Brett Is A Business Technology Analyst Consultant.

In the last year, the value locked into DeFi has increased 1500% to US$8B, according to DeFi Pulse.\n\nAs some analysts question how disruptive it will be to traditional finance, Crypto.com and BCG indicate that, although DeFi has the potential to disrupt traditional finance, leaders in incumbent financial services also have the opportunity to participate in and shape its impact on their businesses.\n\nKaj Burchardi, Managing Director with BCG Platinion said: \u201cWhether companies choose to embrace decentralised finance or not, they still need to understand the impact it will have and track customer demand for autonomy, especially in payments, loans and exchange. By uncovering current levels of liquidity, charting the progress of regulation, and judging levels of risk \u2013 companies can continually assess whether services should be substituted for a more decentralised model. By partnering with Crypto.com, we have been able to advise companies with an honest appraisal on DeFi, giving them the tools to make informed decisions on its adoption.\u201d\n\nCeFi and DeFi\n\nRegulation and governance have given the centralised finance (CeFi) industry an enormous proportion of the value generated from financial services. While DeFi may be perceived as a threat to CeFi, Crypto.com and BCG\u2019s report offers a roadmap for financial services leaders to build a new generation of politically and technologically resilient financial solutions that are valuable and more relevant in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe \u201cSudden Rise of DeFi: Opportunities and Risks for Financial Services\u201d report explores the factors driving the growth of the DeFi industry, which is an Open Finance movement built upon public programmable blockchains such as Ethereum. DeFi\u2019s proponents expect a disruption of mainstream financial services by enabling:\n\nfinancial services to be automated and performed by anyone\n\noperation without a central authority or intermediary.\n\nThat said the report tempers the anticipated the wilder claims and beliefs of DeFi proponents. Instead it offers:\n\nan assessment of the potential of DeFi\n\nan examination of the current challenges facing the industry\n\na look at the underlying technologies.\n\nKris Marszalek, Co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com said: \u201cOur joint research into DeFi provides a deep dive into the reasons behind its growth, differentiators against CeFi and its potential to disrupt mainstream finance. Whereas much existing research into DeFi is project-specific and crypto-centric, this report leverages both Crypto.com and BCG\u2019s respective areas of expertise to deliver a comprehensive side-by-side comparison with incumbents in traditional finance.\u201d\n\nFrom the Crypto.com/BCG report: place big bets\n\nA key part of the report focuses on what steps to take when adopting DeFI. It lists the following recommended activities:\n\ndefine your DeFi ecosystem and its potential (and emphasises analysing the role a participant can or should play in the ecosystem during the introduction of a DeFi protocol and associated applications \u2013 see diagram below)\n\nunderstand the opportunities for DeFi and decentralisation in an organisation and within its industry\n\nbe prepared to place big bets.\n\nIn the last section the report says: \u201cCompanies applying disruptive technologies and building new business models must place big bets. That means positioning respective projects as transformational new revenue initiatives. Therefore, DeFi initiatives will require internal sponsorship and an adequate level investment to secure the first-mover advantage and realise the expected benefits. Lastly, although regulation and compliance, or lack thereof, is one of the key risks that companies need to understand and manage, it also presents the key opportunity for emerging DeFi solutions.\u201d\n\nEnterprise Times: what does this mean\n\nDeFi has undoubted potential to bridge the inequality gap. It can do this by disrupting traditional finance \u2013 by making money, payments and other financial services universally accessible. Yet this carries the risk of disruption of CeFi, which might incur a massive penalty on every business and person.\n\nAs the Crypto.com and BCG Platinion report describes, DeFi can offer new ways for banking, trading and investing \u2013 perhaps even setting the standard for hidden economies to climb out of the shadows. Yet, as the report says, DeFi is encouraging commercial financial institutions, central banks and the crypto community to start collaborating in order to build a new-generation of resilient financial solutions. These will only have significance if DefI does not become hyper-focused on emerging economies or pure innovation.
